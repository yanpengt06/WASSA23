1	35	How sad is it that this kind of pain and suffering, and those kind of living conditions still exsist today? what a gap we have in society between developed countries and those that aren't. It's crazy to drive around the US and see all the money people spend on pointless things, and then to think about how the people in Haiti are living. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	0
4	35	The article is kind of tragic and hits close to home as I am the son of Haitian immigrants. Haiti has a lot of problems that only become exaggerated during natural disasters. I think what the Haitian people really need from the international community is help developing infrastructure so they can address these issues themselves. Foreign aid only acts as a band aid.	79	1	6	3	33	64000	1	dev	3
7	213	I think that these kinds of stories, are sad, yet inspirational and leave you with kind of a good feeling. Even though his story is sad, it's cool and inspiring/motivational to see that he rose up against his circumstances. That he worked hard to make something of himself and he succeeded in what he wanted to do. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	6
9	213	It's crazy that random accidents like this happen everyday. I am not a baseball fan but of course enjoy a baseball game every now and again. I lived and worked in Miami too so I am vaguely familiar with that baseball player who unfortunately passed away. The effort to save him was great but unfortunately bad things seem to happen every day. He was so young too so it makes it worse. 	84	2	4	1	25	55000	1	dev	8
12	78	This story makes me so so sad.... As someone who also grew up in the system, I can strongly relate. It's sad that America has not figured out a better and more safe system to handle kid's without parents or with parents who are unfit. A lot of the times, the system is no better, or even worse than the situation kids were in before, and I think this story is a good example of that. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	11
15	78	After reading the article, my first reaction and feeling is that i feel really bad for the brothers. I feel like people their age should not have to be locked inside a jail cell. They should be out in the world improving themselves and being normal people. It's also really sad for the family members of these brothers as well because they are probably all suffering and worrying.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	14
16	336	I didn't know coal mining had such adverse effects on the surrounding environment. It has basically ruined the lives of the people who live nearby these mines. And the animal populations too, imagine a heard of elephants not able to sustain themselves with the food available and needing to invade human territory...They must really be in a desperate situation. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	1	dev	15
20	336	This is very sad.  I can't imagine having elephants come stampede my house in the middle of the night.  What a terrible and sad situation, and these poor people can't even do anything about it.  Someone needs to stop the deforestation and stop polluting the air these people breathe, it is not right ehat they are doing and all for the sake of turning a profit.  	73	2	7	1	38	42000	1	dev	19
23	281	Guys, reading this article really hits home for me. If you  or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please get help from the available sources. Suicide is no joke and it is a shame when someone does not get the help they need. I've struggled with this for a few years now but I got the help I needed. This woman was not as fortuante.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	22
26	171	Hey guys. So I just read this article about Iraqi Christians being persecuted by Muslims in Iraq. I don't understand why people of different religious backgrounds can't get along there. I'm sure it is a cultural thing but it is such unneccesary violence and conflict. It hurts both sides and I wish there was a way we could get them to set aside their differences. But not military action. We don't need another war.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	25
28	171	This was pretty troubling to read about the events going on overseas. The families are struggling so much and there's no hope in sight for them to get any relief. Looking over their backs all the time and trying to protect their children. Trying to maintain work available to support their family. I can't imagine what it would be like.	69	2	2	1	34	60000	1	dev	27
29	171	This article made me think about something that I have never thought about before. Returning to a place where a war happen is not only the repairing of the physical, but the place may have memories that you may never want to return to. For some reason, I always thought that people would just be able to return when the fighting stopped. 	75	1	6	3	37	40000	1	dev	28
34	386	I hate hearing stories like this... I feel so bad for veterans, not only for what they have to deal with if they were on the battlefield, but because of the lack of respect for them in this country. Even if you don't agree with the war we are fighting, that is not their fault, don't take it out on them, take it out on their leaders. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	33
44	289	I just read an article about cancer and how it effects a person. I know how cancer feels; I've dealt with family members getting cancer in my childhood. It was rough. But it takes a lot fo strength to get through the treatments. And I just want to say that if you have cancer, you can do it. you can beat it and get through it. No matter how gloomy the day may be look forward to a brighter tomorrow.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	43
45	289	"This kind of stuff makes me so sad... I hate cancer... It's crazy, with how far advanced we are that we don't have a better cure for it yet... And that the only ""treatment"" really is pumping poison into your body... I do think that big pharma has something to do with this, because there is so so so much money to be made off of cancer. "	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	44
52	49	It's so sad that our disregard for the environment since the Industrial Age is having such an effect on the entire planet. The ice melting too soon is going to have such an effect on polar bears and pretty much every animal. I'm not sure what we can possibly do to prevent polar bears from dying out because of a lack of food. They need that ice to hurt seals and without it, they are restricted to what they can hunt on land. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	1	dev	51
57	72	I feel sad that elephants can't even be protected how they should be. The fact that a bid to give them high level protection was defeated tells me that money rules overall and it has been that way and will always be that way and it is something I can not just grasp my head around and accept as a fact of life because it just is not fair.	71	1	6	2	32	35000	1	dev	56
59	72	Any tyoe of animal poaching and killing just really hurts my heart. It is disgusting that this kind of thing is still happening and that not everyone can agree to fiercly protect these gentle giants. I get that these countries are poor and this kind of hunting and trading brongs in big money for them but I think they need to look at the bigger picture and more countries should help build these countries up in others ways so they dont have to rely on this for there people and economy. I also agree with the conservationist that say all the paper laws in the world cant cut down on the killings if you dont control illigal trade that is were the focus needs to stay on.	96	2	3	1	27	25000	1	dev	58
67	138	I wasn't bullied much as a child but I can really sympathize with people who there. You're a lot more narrow minded as a child and getting bullied can make it seem like your entire life is ruined. I think it's a bigger problem now because of technology. Before a child would only get bullied during school hours, hopefully outside of the sight of a teacher. Now children can be bullied 24/7 through technology since everyone has a cell phone and uses social media. It's a hard problem to solve. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	1	dev	66
68	138	I just read an article about bullying in France. Apparently, the suicide of a 17 year old French girl has caused the country to reevaluate its approach toward bullying. I personally have never experienced intense bullying or ridicule first hand or even second hand. I guess I was a pretty likable kid after all. I think the key to solving problems like this is most definitely inclusion. The reason children feel this way is because they perceive themselves to be absolutely alone.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	1	dev	67
72	3	Did you read this article? It's so heartbreaking I cannot take it. News stories don't affect me unless there is kids involved and the image of the little girls wandering around calling for her mum and the two children that lost their mother. It's horrific. It's also making me rethink rides like these because you know I love the kali river rapids at Disney which this sounds similar too. Maybe I should just stay away from rides all together. They just aren't safe.	77	2	2	1	34	50000	1	dev	71
82	353	I wish there was more details...How did this happen? Did maybe the kid fall off the cliff and when his father tried to save him, he also fell off? Were they running and didn't realize they were able to fall off a cliff? This is just a strange and really sad story. I hope that somebody puts fencing alongside where they fell, so this doesn't happen to anyone else. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	1	dev	81
84	353	So I just read an article about how a father and his son died from a fall while hiking because there was a problem with the rescue chopper and they couldn't get to them in time. I think that is completely unacceptable. Why wasn't there a second rescue chopper? Is there no such thing as a back up? The loss of life could have been prevented.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	83
86	304	I just read an article about suicides in children between 10 and 14. Even though I as not aware of the recent spike in these types of fatalities, I am aware that they happen. Years ago when I was visiting my relatives in OK there was buzz around the town about a boy of only 12 that hung himself after he was punished by his father for misbehaving. To think of someone that young taking their own life is absolutely heartbreaking.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	1	dev	85
87	304	It's pretty heartbreaking to hear and read stories about suicide. I have always felt like there is more that can be done for mental health with young and older people these days.  It's not only the youth that struggle with it but it seems so normalized at a younger age. I feel strongly that there is no excuse for someone to kill themselves.  Anything can be prevented and anyone can be helped. It's a hard time and age though and usually those kids feel like there is nothing left for them to live for when in reality they have an entire wonderful life ahead of themselves, regardless of past experiences. But that's just my opinion. 	84	2	4	1	25	55000	1	dev	86
92	233	What happened in the article was very upsetting to read. I felt really bad for the women that got raped. It was also terrible because it stated that many of them were impregnated by these soldiers and there was pretty much nothing they could do about it. It's so damaging not only for the woman but for the unborn child as well.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	91
93	233	Unfortunately in countries like these the officials are so corrupt you can't expect any justice to be made. I feel like overall it is what makes the most sense to me. Not expecting justice is a normal thing in Nigeria. I feel like there is no two ways about it and overall I feel disappointed that us as a world can only sit back and watch and not do anything about it.	71	1	6	2	32	35000	1	dev	92
96	57	I think it is absolutely saddening that these animals  were neglected in such a bad area of the world. Not only were a lot killed/starved but they were in a warzone! Who thought it was a good idea to put a zoo right in one of the most fought over areas in the middle east? Those poor animals had to suffer for people's enjoyment in a horrible place.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	95
101	67	"it's a shame that this keeps happening,but it's the quasi ""acceptance"" of economic migrants that causes this to happens.As long as these people have incentive they will put themselves in dangerous situation to migrate to Europe. European leaders need to take a stand and tell these people to stay home because they will not be allowed to remain if they come in unauthorized ways. "	59	1	2	1	30	55000	1	dev	100
104	67	I cannot see how a situation like this should happen in the modern world. Countries have become so closed off that they are not even willing to let people seek asylum in their country. They would rather people die making the dangerous trip to safety rather than open the gates. This just makes me want to fight for migrant rights. So many countries were build upon immigrant populations giving their support to country's that they arrive in and now people want to close the doors.	60	1	2	1	30	30000	1	dev	103
106	134	It's really sad what happeend to the people after reading the article. I felt like the people that were living in that area did not deserve what happened to them. They must have been struggling deeply. They probably had no water for a long time and the children there were probably very thirsty. I also think that climate change has a big factor in this.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	105
115	45	The state in the middle east is a mess. I wish we are not involved as it is not our business, but fo course we must be the world police. I do not think we should be picking sides in pollitical struggles that do not pertain to us. By doing so we just create more needless death. Let them settle their own problems.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	114
121	6	I think what these people are going through is terrible. I think that empathy being taught in school and other places would be a good idea to some extent. I think that people really have to hvae that trait inside them in order for it to work. I think that teaching someone empathy is useless if they don't really believe in it.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	120
123	6	We all need to ask ourselves Can empathy for refugees be taught? A few weeks ago, I scrambled to evacuate my area with the only five items I could grab?my phone, passport, water, money, and medicine?in the 30 seconds before I had to flee. Many of the roughly 65 million refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced people around the world today have had to make panicked choices like these; more than 4,000 have died at sea in overcrowded boats and rafts attempting to reach Europe from the Middle East. I wish people around the world show more empathy to the needy.	61	2	6	3	22	100000	1	dev	122
125	6	There should be empathy to refugees. They didnt chose their situation. They are just victim of circumstances. I wish I can really help them. More love and support should be given to them. I dont imagine myself losing all the things I have. I cant count the number of times people have lost their homes and all	85	1	7	1	28	165000	1	dev	124
127	314	I tihnk it is so sad that that man lost his wife and kid in a car wreck. If the person who hit them was indeed street racing; he caused a family unknowable greif. No one deserves to die liek that; on fir ein a car. And no one deserves to go through that kind of grief. I hope that man gets the support he needs, and I hope his family did not have to suffer before they passed.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	126
130	314	I really hope the guy who caused this accident wasn't street racing. That's so unbelievably dangerous and stupid. The dad and surviving family could maybe cope with it a little better if the person who slammed into their relatives van wasn't doing anything stupid and it was just an accident. It's sad a sad story. Out of nowhere, half their family is dead, instantly. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	1	dev	129
133	73	I think it is kinda messed up the way Jolie acts in her relationships. Wearing a vial of eachother's blood? That is weird. I wonder if she was overly controlling as well. I dated someone who was extremely controlling and manipulative and it was one fo the worst periods of my life. I feel for all the guys she's been with.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	132
135	73	It's funny to read snippets of celebrity lives. I don't follow much celebrity news at all and find most of it pretty terrible usually. I don't have much sympathy for them either. Unfortunately most of their actions are money or popularity driven. I also think they really don't take marriage seriously because the divorce rate with celebrities is outrageous. They want to live fast and free and they tend to not make the greatest decisions. Not saying all are like that, but it seems like most. 	84	2	4	1	25	55000	1	dev	134
137	99	I think divorce is always sad, even when children are grown.  However, this is also just one divorce in a great big world and I can't say I really care.  I thought it was sort of peculiar how tritely the article dealt with the situation, though, seemingly paying more attention to how hot the dad was instead of the dissolution of a family.  And you wonder why marriages dissolve after 27 years and the kids grown.  What changes to push people to divorce at that point.  Maybe for married people that's not a complicated question, but I'm not married so I don't know.  Either way I think it's too bad for the girls that their parents are divorced.  But I'm not really moved by it.	91	1	6	1	41	28000	1	dev	136
143	94	I felt like what i read in the article was very disturbing. The things that are going on around the world is very troublesome. It is terrible to know that people are being hung from poles and innocent people are just being killed left and right. It is so inhumane and something i can never even imagine.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	142
144	94	As fighting continued in and around Mosul on Friday, civilians caught in crossfire have a stark choice: whether to flee or stay huddled inside their homes. Many residents tell CNN the intensity of the fighting and the airstrikes in eastern parts of the city limited their options. Still, tens of thousands have chosen the escape route. More than 47,730 people have been displaced because of the ongoing military operations to retake Mosul from ISIS, according to the International Organization for Migration. Recording so many death as such really makes me sad. wish there is something that could be done.	61	2	6	3	22	100000	1	dev	143
146	147	Wow, 100,000 deaths is a massive amount!  I found this very  it makes me very sad for the people involved especially the fact so many infants and children's were affected.  This just seems like something that could have been very avoidable if the right steps were taken. I mean a haze killing 100,000 people?  That's crazy! I think it's sad that it's happening in what is probably an underfunded area where the people don't really have much freedom.  Overall this is just a bad situation, it makes me very sad for the people involved.	73	2	7	1	38	42000	1	dev	145
150	147	I think what hapepend in Indonesia is terrible. The haze and fire really damaged lots of people's homes as well as took lives. I can't even imagine to think what it would be like if everything i had was just engulfed in flames and burned. I feel really bad for the families as well as people that have lost a loved one in this.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	149
151	125	House fires are nojoke. And theyc an happen to anyone at any time. I feel so bad that that poor family are now without a home and there beloved pets. I hope their animals didn't have to suffer before they passed and I hope that the family is able to move on from this tragedy and will be able to continue their lives from this point on.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	150
159	302	It's sad that humans have the destroyed/damaged the world to the point that it is starting to give us cancer! How crazy sad is that... Why can't we find more enviormentally friendly ways to do things? I'm sure the ways are out there, but theres no money in it so they haven't been discovered yet...  how gross is that	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	158
164	375	We as a whole community of human beings must come together to save this beautiful majestic animals. WE have obviously not learned our lesson of past animal extinctions and still put endangered animals in even more danger. Norway should put out strict laws for visitors and harsh sentences should they break these laws as well!	71	1	6	2	32	35000	1	dev	163
166	228	I can't believe that anyone let's this type of behavior continue. Who let's their children be basically sold into slavery and then what government and officials allows it to happen. It's sad, disgusting and disturbing that this is something that is allowed to go on. It says something about the state of the world that this is what we've come to and that we just let it continue on. People should do more to ensure this behavior doesn't continue.	87	2	6	1	46	22000	1	dev	165
173	400	The article lacks clarity on whether Isbindi was a child or a rhino. I am more than a little confused. I have neutral feelings toward the story as it was presented. Any loss of life is tragic, but more so when it is an innocent and defenseless child. I was also quite curious as what exactly was the cause of death.	79	1	6	3	33	64000	1	dev	172
175	400	I think it is so sad for that baby rhino to die so young.. Any creature deserves a chance at life, and for this baby's to be taken away so soon is just heartbreaking. Also the fact that it was an orphan makes it even sadder. I used to work at an animal rescue place and sometimes we would ahve animals that wouldn't make it.. it is really hard to see an animal pass.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	174
178	283	I found it interesting that there were Saudi women for and against the guardianship program. I think in a broader sense this will only inflame tensions between Saudi's and the west as the more traditional Saudi's will undoubtedly blame western culture for these ideas. The fear of encroachment of western values into their culture has been a fear of Saudi Arabia since the kingdom's inception.	79	1	6	3	33	64000	1	dev	177
180	283	This kind of thing makes me so sad to hear... I can't believe things like this are still happening in todays day and age, after all the advancements that humanity has made as far as technology, racism, sexism, classism, and this kind of thing still is going on... It's awful and it's sad that we don't hear more about it in the media. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	179
194	313	I felt like this was really sad for the people involved.  They are caught in a situation with no real solution and there is not much they can do.  I try to imagine being in their shoes and it is diffivult to fathom, but I am certain it would be very difficult and distressing.  No one should have to fear for their life on a day to day basis and it sounds like Germany is making decisions som ewhat arbitrarily or with bias.  However, on the same token it is up to Germany to decide who they want to let in, and it is generous of them to do so to start with.  So there is that.	73	2	7	1	38	42000	1	dev	193
201	31	I find humanities lack of care for the environment disgusting. The fact the there are companies that profit off the destruction of forests and homes and animals is mind blowing. Entire acres of forest are being destroyed for the wood they hold. Inside those forests are animals that have homes and families. They are all being displaced, or worse killed, by these greedy businessmen looking to turn a profit off of nature. After reading this article it sounds like the government of Indonesia is not committed to protecting the forests or the animals living in them. It almost seems like they are making money off of the death of nature, and so they are turning a blind eye to the violation of its very own laws. 	90	2	6	1	35	32000	1	dev	200
204	31	This is a very serious situation as it affects both the wildlife and forest situation in Indonesia. It affects the population of the endangered Orangutan species. The government must do everything to protect the trees, provide rangers to protect the life of the Orangutans. Provisions should be made to reduce wildfire. 	80	1	6	1	35	120000	1	dev	203
210	201	I know there are a lot of specific circumstances and things pertaining to police shootings of African Americans, but hoenstly a lot of these cases seem like the cop is just really trigger happy. And honestly that is unacceptable. African Americans are racially profiled and that is wrong. I think there has to be something done with our law enforcement to make these shootings less likely to occur.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	1	dev	209
215	273	This is crazy to me that this sort of stuff is going on right now in the US over oil/money... Shooting a kids horse?? That sounds like something that would have happened in medieval times or the 1800s or something, not 2020. This is so sad... adn this has been going on for far to long. A generation is growing up in this. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	214
219	247	Dear friend,                                        I have just read a horrifying and disturbing article about a terror attack that happened in Paris, france in 2015. There were 90 people killed at a rock concert after terrorists opened fire and set of bombs inside of the music venue. This was a truly horrible event.	64	1	2	5	29	44000	1	dev	218
220	247	The terrific massacre that happened a year ago is really a bad situation to be in. I feel for the victims of this horrible experience may their souls rest in peace. I hope we have better security at events henceforth. ISIS truly is a pain in the ass and I just so wish that all perpetrator be caught and justice be passed 	82	1	7	1	46	150000	1	dev	219

I hope people who have ponds or want ponds in their yard will be made aware or make themselves aware of the danger of this, and how to prevent it as well as stop the spread. That is the only way this will get better	68	2	2	1	21	20000	1	dev	229
234	128	I am never sure what to think about these people.  I mean if he did actually harrass her that is bad and deserves attention.  But if she is just making up the allegations then shame on her.  I think the me too movement has gone too far with too many people making up allegations and ruining the lives of men.  However, in this case Thomas was already guilty of harrassing Anita Hill so it is probably more likely to be true.  Either way it is always hard to tell.  	73	2	7	1	38	42000	1	dev	233
250	177	I must say I really disagree with her politics and am not at all a fan of hers.  However, it is always sad for a person to suffer from a disease such as Parkinson's so I am sympathetic for what she must have gone through as well as for her family as well.  I'm sure it was hard on them watching her deteriorate and suffer and that is always so rough on the family.  So regardless of how I feel about her career or her actions, I have sympathy for what she went through and for her family's feelings.	73	2	7	1	38	42000	1	dev	249
270	47	After reading the article, you really can't help but feel bad for all the people that are required to leave the area. It feels as though there is always war and people will never feel safe. They always are on the lookout and can never live a stable and happy life like others do. I feel really bad for them and i hope that their future is better than it is now.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	1	dev	269
278	370	You would never even realize how relevant world hunger is until you read articles like this. We are so lucky in the US to not have to worry about kids going hungry.

And with so much media almost glamorizing suicide, it's important to make sure your kid isn't watching this kind of stuff. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	2	dev	585
87	304	So suicide rates are climbing in our youth today. I know this topic very personally. I suffer from chronic depression and when I was 19 tried to take my own life. What the article says is true. Parents, talk to your kids, be there for them. Listen when they need you to. I had problems with that; and combined with a lot of other trauma, I reached a breaking point. Don't let your kids reach that point.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	2	dev	586

These women must've trusted their ""saviors"" and that trust was abused. This honestly makes me sick.

93	233	I think it is abysmal that womena re getting raped in that part of the world. Sexual abuse is no laughing matter and the people who commit these atrocities need to pay for their actions. Taking advantage of someone; no matter their gender, background, or religious preference, is unacceptable. And the fact that not much is being done about it makes it even more disgusting.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	2	dev	592

A mission where you need to have diplomatic talks with three different countries!! It really shows that some special people out there won't pass the buck to someone else, expecting someone else to do the heavy lifting to save something. I was really inspired by this article and I hope they end up setting up that animal center in Gaza. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	2	dev	595
101	67	I think something has to be done about the migrant situation in the mediterranean. The migrants take very rough routes and in really ill prepared boats. Many die because there are not official migration routes for refugees. It is a shame that these people ahve to risk their lives just to get into a better country.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	2	dev	600
104	67	It's really sad that so many people need to flee from their war torn homelands for a better life. Those people must be so desperate to get into these overfilled boats when every day there must be a story about drowned migrants. A lot of the blame should go to the people who are organization these trips too. They are probably being paid handsomely but still can't transport the people safely. 	81	1	4	1	30	27000	2	dev	603

Surely we can find a more peaceful way.	77	2	2	1	34	50000	2	dev	614

Large swaths of society have fallen under the ""just world"" fallacy and think people deserve what they get, somehow through whatever choices they made, and then accordingly believe that it couldn't possibly happen to them because they wouldn't make these choices. That makes it easy for them to dismiss those upsetting situations and not show any caring for those suffering. These attitudes need to be combatted. "	89	2	7	1	35	60000	2	dev	622

Most Americans are empathetic when we hear stories or see images however when the moment for us to do anything come along we don't find the nerve to act. The mock home evacuation was very interesting however it cannot fully convey the actual feeling people feel when their lives are ripped from them. It will take something different to move people to the point where they realize these people are legitimately fighting for their lives. 	88	1	6	3	30	55000	2	dev	624

They get bad ones every year.	63	1	4	1	25	29000	2	dev	645

People die so frequently from this disease I wish there was more awareness and laws put in place to help reduce it. I think cigarettes should be outlawed instead of weed. It has been proven the harm they can do to people and kill them, its crazy that there still around to this day. I think more air pollution laws need to be put in place because people cant really help that alot and that clearly has an effect on human life. People should move to less air polluted states once they are diagnosed.	96	2	3	1	27	25000	2	dev	658

It is actually so saddening that a population of Orangutan an endangered species mind you, is on the brink of eradication at the hands of oil companies within the area.

They are trying to protect what is theres and water for there people. They believe in the contract that was signed and want to keep the promise. On the other hand the police are just doing there job and trying to keep from any bad things happening. When you have people firing guns at police that is when things have to get more serious and they have to use force. You cant just block roads and set cars on fire.

I think that more awareness on what to do and what not to do when it comes to frogs and ponds needs to be out there on the news and told to people so they know maybe alot of it is just ignorance. Any living being should be protected if possible from dying a painful death and frogs are an important part of our ecosystem that we need to protect.

409	331	I'm really not sure why men are so afraid of women in positions of power. My boss is a woman and she does her job effectively and interacts with people with good nature and aplomb. I think that breaking centuries old social norms and structures takes a lot of work that most humans are unwilling to do. It's like self help for an entire species.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	2	dev	908
412	112	It seems like we hear about this sort of thing all the time! It's becoming way to common. When will he stop ruining our oceans and oceanlife! When will a measure be put in place to prevent this or to diminish the occurance of it. It seems like we hear abuout it all the time, but we never hear about the punishment or what is being done to fix it. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	911
423	133	I don't get why people think it's ok to act this way? Why would you hurt any sort of animal? It makes me wonder this guys mental state and what else he has done, because if he thinks this is ok to do to a flamingo out in the public, then what does he think it's ok to do to another animal or even a human behind closed doors? 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	922
425	133	What is human nature coming to?   Zoo visitors attacking the wildlife and inflicting such horrendous injuries that she had to be put down.   I can't imagine what in the world that would cause a human being to do that.   His bond was too low.   It should be very high.   Laws are so ridiculous.   We do the laws that should not be on the books.   	65	2	6	1	62	29000	2	dev	924
431	13	It seems like every other day you hear about a drone attack in the middle east that has killed innocent people. Frankly, I could care less about the number of American soldiers who are killed in conflicts overseas. They knew what they signed up for and they paid the ultimate price in service of their country. These entire families that are being killed and maimed did absolutely nothing to deserve this kind of treatment.	74	1	4	1	29	39000	2	dev	930
445	7	This kind of this is so so sad to read about! I can't imagine living somewhere like that, where destruction can just happen so suddenly. It would be nerve wracking. I can't imagine trying to recover after devestation like that either... it would be so hard. Those people are strong willed I will give them that! 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	944
449	11	Living in a war tore country must be horrible. I feel the pain of all the lost. Having air strikes hit your home has to be horrible and seeing love ones buried under what is left from your home is also horrible. I do not wish this on anybody. I hope that the country can find peace and the people can return to a normal life.	75	1	6	3	37	40000	2	dev	948
451	182	I can't imagine the kind of person that would do this to a sweet cute innocent kitten. Not only did they dump it on the side of the road, which is one kind of evil, but they tortured it in the process. Who ties up a kitten like that? It's so easy now a days if you don't want a kitten, put it on facebook or cragslist to get rid of it. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	950
455	182	I hate reading stories like this... I don't get how there are still people in the world that can do this to an innocent animal... And not even just dumping it on the side of the road, that's one thing, but tying it up just to make it suffer? That is some pretty sick stuff. This person obviously is not mentally sound	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	954
456	371	Another story about police brutality... I'm not surprised. While it does sound like this individual was giving the police a harder time than was needed, they are the professionals here and need to act like it. I don't think what she was doing warranted getting punched in the face. That is not a professional measure to subdue someone. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	955
459	371	A woman was arrested for assault, and during the arrest, the officer punches her in the face. The police department acknowledges this and it was captured on camera by several onlookers for the incident. Even the children witnessed the incident occur. It isn't clear if they even had a legitimate reason to arrest her.	76	1	5	1	38	96000	2	dev	958
462	18	I think things like this are terrifying, especially because it seems like things are just starting to heat up in Syria and we haven't even started sending that many troops over there. It makes me nervous that it's going to be another long war and one that will will fight for seemingly no real benefit of our own. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	961
471	297	After reading the article, you can't help but feel bad for the people that were involved in the train crash. IT was a freak accident and something you can't control. It 's just sad because they had to leave all of their family behind and their lives will most likely never be the same. While reading it, i felt really worried because it could happen to anyone.	70	1	6	1	29	85000	2	dev	970
478	53	I am definiltly guilty of wasting food. I buy it all with the best of intentions, but either don't use as much as I need, or end up eating out and not cooking at home a night or two  a week, thus wasting all the food I bought for those specific meals. It's definitly sad how much money and resources we was on this, where there really is very little reason forit. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	977
484	292	I wish this article had given us more info. Were there any people hurt? Where did this shooting take place exactly? I'm honestly a bit glad the guy killed himself, one because he can't hurt anyone else that way.  And two because that way a police officer does not have to deal with the trauma of killing someone. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	983
494	218	This story is really horrifying to me. Knowing how bad lead is for people especially children this article is suprising. The fact that this seems so hush hish i scary. I am very glad I have been drinking bottled water for my family. I do not trust the government and this shows why. How could levels be so high and nothing be done and consumers not know. We are poisoning ourselves and familys and not even know. Something needs to be done to fix this issue!	96	2	3	1	27	25000	2	dev	993
497	103	An option for this very well may be that the man was so drunk, and he was so out of it, that he went into his hotel room and banged around/fell or did something stupid to accidentally kill himself. He also could have very well done this on purpose too. Or the other option is that someone killed him. Either way, it's a sad waste of life. 	68	2	2	1	21	20000	2	dev	996
