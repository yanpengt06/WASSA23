I get really angry when I hear that one of our soldiers have lost their life in the Taliban or any other place overseas. These brave men and women put their lives on the line to protect their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy. It's important to honor their sacrifices and remember their service. It's also essential to reflect on the causes and consequences of war and strive to find peaceful solutions to conflicts whenever possible. 
I believe that we should work towards a way that conflicts can be solved without the loss of life. For example we can use drones or machines in some situations instead of using one of our own people. I often get quite sad."	65	1	6	1	34	30000	1	test	1
1059	6	"Hello mate, it's been a long time since I met you, I hope you are well. I am sending you this message to inform you about a recent incident.
  It was two American troops killed fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan; Civilians were affected by the airstrikes. At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and several wounded in an airstrike early Thursday as NATO and Afghan forces battled Taliban militants in northern Kunduz province, Afghan officials and witnesses said.
A US airstrike mistakenly targeted an emergency hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 patients and staff. More than 20 civilians from various families were killed. Another provincial council member, Ghulam Rabbani, said 36 people were killed. Know more about this news friend

1060	6	My thought was NATO and government forces are increasingly responsible for Afghan civilian deaths. A portion of the strategic provincial capital was briefly overrun by insurgents last month, and Afghan troops assisted by U.S. forces have been trying to clear them from the area. The confusing and deadly drama recalled the tragic events in Kunduz just over a year ago, when the Taliban overran the city and Afghan and NATO forces were trying to beat them back. In the chaos, a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted an emergency hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 patients and staff members. As of late Thursday, NATO officials had not confirmed or commented on the reported deaths of the civilians, who were said to be members of several families living in a neighborhood neared.	47	2	7	1	34	75000	1	test	4
1060	6	This was a deadly mistake. I believe everybody even countries make mistakes but this was a huge one that ended numerous lives and effected thousands others. I hope that the US will compensate everyone effected. There is no way to bring the loved ones back, but money will certainly help those effected by the tragedy. And then make sure that this cant happen again. I know friendly fire happens but this is crazy. Verify the target and then reverify the target three more times.	48	2	4	3	35	14000	2	test	5
1068	8	"This is so sad. I wish America could take more refugees. These people need safe places to go. I'm so happy to be an American and don't have to worry about these things. Although it's bad enough that I have to worry about sending my kids to school and them getting shot. I couldn't imagine my country beeing so un-safe that I needed to pack my family and flee the country.

1068	8	Desperate people can often find themselves in desperate situations. I wonder, if my family or I were in a place where my very life was at risk, what would I do? Would I think of the consequences? Would I only hope for survival? Sometimes it is hard to visualize certain things when those things are too horrible, but I know that I would probably do some things that were not normal for me. For example if I were a fleeing war-torn country, would I be worried about drowning? Probably not.	75	2	5	2	46	75000	2	test	7
1072	9	I suppose this explosion was caused by illegal fuel. If the fuel was being transported legally this event could have been avoided and many lives saved. use of illegal fuel is a serious issue that requires action from governments, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to address. This may involve strengthening regulations and enforcement mechanisms, as well as promoting the use of clean and sustainable energy sources.	65	1	5	1	34	25000	1	test	8

1074	9	Well, i read there was a fuel tanker explosion in Mazambique this past Thursday is so sad. Killed 73 people and injured over 100 they said it was a massacre of sorts because they were burn bodies like everywhere. And they said in the article that they didn't know what caused the explosion, but they had a Assumption of sorts that, a fire near the tanker caused it to explode. It sure is sad.	61	2	2	1	44	21000	1	test	10
1074	9	I read in an article about 73 people that died in an explosion in Mozambique. 110 other people were injured. I think that it was a tanker that exploded. Can you imagine being on the road and something like that happening? 73 people gone, just like that. It really puts into perspective how fleeting life is and how any of us could go at any time. The article said that the incident was ongoing as recovery efforts were hampered by night. Its possible that there are more casualties and injuries. As far as I could tell they didn't know what caused the explosion but two theories are that it was because a fire near the tanker or it could have happened due to lightning near where people were collecting fuel. Imagine going to the pump and dying because of a lightning strike out of your control.	81	1	5	6	38	50000	2	test	11
1080	10	This is an article about an area in Indonesia that has a substantial orangutan population that is apparently endangered. There are plans to do some excavation or deforestation or some such (it is not clear in the article because it seems there's some translation errors). These plans, if gone through with, will likely wipe out half of the existing 1700 orangutan population. Some are opposed and others support this as it can improve the local economy.	33	1	3	1	57	22000	1	test	12
1080	10	"I had a hard time understanding this article, but check it out. You know I like trees and hate people cutting them down, but you know I hate government regulation too. Individuals need to decide for themselves that their quest for profits may actually decrease them in the future. I feel bad for the orangutans,  but don't get why people who believe in evolution do. Maybe they will evolve into something better able to deal with the new environment.  Ir's not possible to try to preserve every animal either.

1083	11	"Helmand province, in the restive south, more than 60,000 people have been displaced this year and thousands more have fled to neighboring provinces and beyond. The U.N. refugee agency has erected a center for the hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees arriving from Pakistan.

The government is worried about the return of refugees to areas where insurgents are active"	44	2	6	1	25	90000	1	test	14
1083	11	"Here are my thoughts on the building refugee/displacement crisis in Afghanistan. It's easy to view a country like Afghanistan as a monolith, especially when I am so far removed from the situation. It's easy to lump them all together and consider their common fate as earned or deserved. But, when I take a moment to think about it, I know that's wrong. Afghanistan is made up of many different people, all with their own hopes and dreams.

I've never been to Afghanistan, maybe I've never even met someone from there, but I feel confident in guessing that most Afghanis just want a safe and peaceful life for themselves and their families. They are victims, in some sort of power struggle that has spiraled out of control, that really has nothing to do with them.

1085	12	I was reading this story about the aftermath of a hurricane in Haiti and people there really need help right now. You know when a calamity strikes in US or other advanced countries, it still takes herculean efforts to get people to safety and provide them with shelter and food and eventual rebuilding. Now imagine, same calamity striking a poor third world country and the suffering of the people there. As the new story describes, people are hugging on to the bags of flour, not letting go, as they desperately need them to survive. Then there is infrastructure damage, water scarcity and so on. We really should do something about them.	74	1	6	5	37	36000	2	test	16
1085	12	Sometimes you read or watch news about a particular place in the world that does not seem to “get a break”. I read about how Haiti has been suffering for a long time, not only natural disaster but geopolitical issues too. I recall reading about their 2010 earthquake, it seems to me that they will never recover from that. Now a hurricane is threatening lives and the well-being of the Haitian population, I truly  feel sad for them.	75	2	5	2	46	75000	1	test	17
1205	8	I just read about the conflicts that are going on in Syria and other parts of Africa today. They have a crisis there that people are drowning in the ocean trying to flee for safety in refuge of another country. And they are 90 times more likely to die than an American gunshot victim. The civil war in Syria has been going on for many years without an end in sight and it is thought that one in fifty people have died from it. The US and Canada, plus some European countries have agreed to take in refugees from Syria.	70	2	4	1	50	30000	1	test	18

1089	11	I read an article about Afghan refugees returning to Afghanistan. Many of them are being deported from the EU and forced to return. I can't imagine living in and experiencing European quality of life and then having to return to a war torn country. It would seem hopeless given that even the government can't seem to do anything. In addition to competing with locals for resources they also have to deal with insurgents. I'm sorry but at that point I'm not sure if I would care about it being legal but I would find a way to get out of there and go somewhere else. I feel bad about anyone there with a family. That is a huge burden having to worry about family members. I've known some people from countries around that area. They seemed so happy. I couldn't imagine them being forced to go back ther	81	1	5	6	38	50000	1	test	20
1089	11	Abdulhalim fled the northern city of Kunduz this month after days of clashes between militants and security forces. He is now 200 miles away in Kabul, sleeping in a tent and living on aid. This is part of a looming humanitarian crisis that aid agencies are struggling to contain. At least another million Afghans are displaced this year. This includes those fleeing violence or conflict, those escaping poverty and drought, and those forced to return from Pakistan and Iran. Afghanistan agreed to accept -Afghan asylum seekers deported from the European Union in October, with the potential for 100,000 to come back. The U.N. refugee agency warns that the sudden increase. It is about financial crisis of Afghanistan people also. It may affect them long last. Most of them need to rectify it as soon.	90	1	6	1	41	110000	2	test	21
1094	11	It's interesting how chaotic societies can be when they don't work to actively find systems that allow for coexistence, or to weed out the groups that seek to upend peaceful societies.  In most ways, these people have brought this on themselves.  They've never created a tenable situation.  They've harbored terrorists and allowed war to define their nation.  Peace often comes through war and strife.  These people have never banded together and exacted a stable system on their lands and people.  They've never actively sought stability like civilized places have.  That's my attitude, and I think it's a very scientific, objective perspective.  The systems that people live in are their own responsibility.  Things don't just happen to us.  We have to actively push towards something better.	60	1	6	1	45	21000	1	test	22
1094	11	I thought it was devastating reading about the displacement which has been plaguing them. The more statistics were presented the more it became overwhelming to realize how many people were in this situation and could not receive help. I feel like it was out of my control to feel any other type of way but I expected more from the U.N. refugee agency. The mention of this 30 year war had made me wonder if there will actually be change to come.	64	1	6	1	35	52000	2	test	23
1096	10	I think it's terrible that all of these orangutans are stuck in this bad situation. It's unfortunate that something like money is likely to put them out of their habitat but I do understand the position of their government. I wonder what can be done to stop this and to help the orangutans. I would really hate for these endangered animals to get reduced because of humans.	95	1	2	1	33	80000	1	test	24
1096	10	Intensive palm oil production is also creating all kinds of environmental fall-out, including air, soil and water pollution, and soil erosion. On a regional scale, palm oil production has also been associated with robbing Indigenous people of their land and livelihoods. This clearing has destroyed critical habitat for many endangered species—including rhinos, elephants and tigers. Burning forests to make room for the crop is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Intensive cultivation methods result in soil pollution and erosion and water contamination. Deforestation for the benefit of oil palm plantations, mining, infrastructure, illegal logging, forest and peat fires, illegal hunting, and illegal wildlife trade are just a few of the threats against the wild orangutans.	96	2	6	1	33	70000	2	test	25
1098	10	There needs to be more done to address the illegal things being done that is causing these fires.  Preventative measures are key to not putting everyone in the area at risk.  Safety is top priority and the amount of fires in 2015 alone is a very big problem.  Sustainable solutions are needed for fulfillment and development.	97	2	4	3	40	65000	1	test	26
1098	10	I have read an article that needs serious intervention by the international community. A Palm Oil company is clearing forest land so as the can convert it into a commercial plantation. This is a good venture that will bring employment and economic benefits but it is coming at the expense of endangered orangutans in that province. Already works are underway and the 500 to 1000 orangutans will die or need to be rescued. The population now stands at 750- 1750. Serious intervention is needed.	98	2	6	3	30	50000	2	test	27
1099	13	I was quite sad reading about the wolf that got killed by a hunter. There is so much empty space in the Midwest and Northwest of the country that surely there should be enough room for both humans and wolves to coexist without coming into conflict. I would understand there being a problem if the wolf is attacking livestock, but if it is just passing through the area then it should be left well alone. I think few people would disagree with that view if they were to give it some thought.	72	1	6	1	53	90000	1	test	28
1099	13	I just read an article about a wolf that was unnecessarily gunned down in Montana.  It was a really sad story and I really feel for the wolf.  He had apparently traveled 700 miles after being collared by Wildlife Activists.  He might have left his pack to find a mate which they often do. That group is working hard with Congress and also on the streets to stop this type of killing of wolves and I truly hope they are successful.	99	2	5	1	59	45000	2	test	29
1101	13	I read an article about a well-documented wolf that was gunned down by a government sniper. He was saved by the Center for Biological Diversity back in 2014 and his life just ended unnecessarily and brutally in Montana after traveling more than 700 miles. I hope the Center for Biological Diversity can do something about it and make the exterminators pay for what they've done! This is saddening and frustrating at the same time.	67	2	7	5	31	100000	1	test	30
1101	13	i think it is horrible that the punishment for shooting and killing or harming defenseless animals isnt punished by law more that jut maybe a fine.  I know puppy mills and animal cruelty is horrible near my home and i can call and call and nothing gets done.  The aspca near me is a joke and i think evil people will continue to harm animals, wild and pets, until there are more reprocutions. i think it should be just as punishable as being mean to a person i think there should be no difference because if someone can hurt an animal they can hurt a person	101	2	5	3	41	90000	2	test	31
1102	13	This article is a bit silly. I still don't really understand why the wolf needed to die? What is for fun? What someone in danger? The article isn't very informative, it just wants to paint the person who killed the wolf as a bad person. But until we have more details it's just emotional garbage and not worth reading.	49	1	6	1	37	12000	2	test	32
1102	13	Reading this article made me feel very overwhelmed. I didn't think his journey would result in the way it did. The wolf made it so far just to end up being gunned down by a sniper. This is what tore me apart because the wolf's life was taken in a brutal manner. I feel like it could of happened any other way but this way involved guns, bullets, and blood which made it a trifecta of bad feelings for myself.	64	1	6	1	35	52000	1	test	33
1105	13	"              In this article I read, a wolf had travelled 700 miles and then was shot and killed by a ""government sniper"" Apparently he was doing target practice? The animal had been saved from extermination and collared by a biology lab for study. 
          Wolves leave the pack and search for territory and a mate which explains the 700 mile trek."	33	1	3	1	57	22000	2	test	34
1105	13	Apparently there is some uproar over the killing of a wolf that had travelled a great distance while trying to mate.  I have little concern with that since there are more wolves out there and it's not as if the wolf population is in trouble currently.  As long as we are keeping the population at a reasonable level I see no problem with it.  It may seem wrong but it's probably better for nature as a whole.  Especially when it's government controlled.	102	1	6	1	40	243000	1	test	35
1107	13	"Hey! I just read a really sad news article about a young wolf who was hunted down by a government sniper. He had traveled over 700 miles before his life was taken away.

It's really important to protect wolves and other animals that play a crucial role in our ecosystems. There are organizations like the Center for Biological Diversity that are fighting for their safety and trying to hold people accountable for their actions.

Let's all do our part to help protect wildlife and spread awareness about their importance. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that these amazing animals can thrive in their natural habitats."	104	1	4	2	28	100000	1	test	36
1107	13	"I feel strongly that exterminating wolves in the US is not only cruel, but very short-sighted. As far as I am aware, eliminating a particular apex predator can have a ""domino"" effect on the rest of the environment. For example in Yellowstone, the lack of wolves increased the population of deer, which stripped the trees, and so on. Bringing back the wolves restored the environment to its natural balance, which is of benefit to us all. We need to find a way to live amongst ALL the wild animals in our environment, if we want longterm survival for ourselves and all creatures."	105	2	6	1	44	139000	2	test	37
1108	14	This makes me sad.  A guy who seemed like a decent guy (though who knows) is dead for some unknown reason.  They didn't mention anything about the suspect which makes me think they were probably black or female or something.  Why else would no information be given about who it was other than that the media is covering up it was a black guy?  Anyway, it's sad.  He's a dad and husband and was hunted down by some deranged person.  At least that deranged person is dead and is no longer a threat to anyone.  Hopefully they're rotting in hell where they belong.  Seems a senseless waste, and I feel bad for the family of the victim.  Again, who knows what this what actually about, but it seems like a senseless thing and now someone's dad is dead.	60	1	6	1	45	21000	2	test	38
1108	14	I feel really bad for Michael Winchester and his family. I have no idea how someone could get in a place where they feel like they need to kill someone else. The gunman must have had some serious issues. Things like this really shouldn't be happening in the modern day. It also makes me wonder why the gunman was so upset at Michael. Did Michael do something to the gunman?	69	1	7	1	27	59000	1	test	39
1109	14	An airline worker was murdered and the suspect was found dead. I feel saddened by this event. An attack like this on another human being shouldn't have happened. I feel for their family. There should be better gun control, we don't see another country in the world that's as obsessed with gun as American does. I am angry at the so called rights to bear arm when people are dying!	67	2	7	5	31	100000	1	test	40
1109	14	It's terrible that violence like this has to take lives away.  Two families are destroyed by senseless violence that ended up with what result?  What did the murderer really get out of this?  Nothing was solved, no one received any benefits, it was just two lives through away. I cannot think of a situation in which murder should be seen as the best choice.  I don't even believe that the death penalty should stand.  It's not anyone else's job to decide if someone lives or dies.	102	1	6	1	40	243000	2	test	41
1110	14	This is devastating news. An airline employee was killed by a gunman at the Oklahoma City airport, and the suspect was later found dead. It's heartbreaking to hear that the attack was premeditated and that the suspect appeared to have known the victim's schedule and routine. I can't imagine what Michael Winchester's family is going through right now, especially since his son James is a football player for the Kansas City Chiefs. It's also concerning to hear that there were reports of a possible second victim, but thankfully, no one was found. My thoughts are with the victim's family and friends during this difficult time.	37	1	6	1	36	75000	2	test	42
1110	14	Such a tragedy what happened at the airport. A gunman senselessly killed an airline worker and then killed himself. It's tragic and it's sad and just disgusting how somebody could do something like that makes me a little angry that people could do something like that. And the article describes how the video from a TV news station showed a helicopter in the air in the helicopter had a pool of blood showing on the ground from the guy that was killed, which I found a little bit disrespectful for the family	61	2	2	1	44	21000	1	test	43
1113	14	"I just read about the Southwest Employee who was shot and killed at the airport in OKC. He played college football and his son plays for the Chiefs, but I don't think I know the name, do you? Is he a punter?

Anyways, I was totally expecting it to be a disgruntled passenger or something but they didn't give too many details. They said it was premeditated, so it probably was a personal thing. I wonder what it was? 

It's pretty scary to think that some people are so completely unhinged, that they'll just decide to kill you. I hope it was a major issue in a kind of way, at least that way it makes sense.

I also think that people who commit suicide are just weak	77	1	6	1	34	30000	2	test	47
1115	14	I think thus the suspect appeared to have known the victim's schedule and routine. The suspect was later found dead in a pickup truck in a public parking garage. Hundreds of people were stranded inside the terminal for more than three hours before officers began letting them leave slowly. Inbound flights were diverted to other airports, while a jet carrying inmates to a transfer site was allowed to land. Video from a television station helicopter showed a pool of blood about 100 feet from the airport employee parking area. It was not known whether surveillance cameras might show the shooting. Police initially received reports of a possible second victim, but no one was found. Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said in a statement that the airline would cancel all flights scheduled.	47	2	7	1	34	75000	1	test	48

1117	14	"I just heard a player from the 1985 Oklahoma Sooners championship team was murdered at while working for Southwest Airlines. The person who murdered them killed themself in the parking garage. His son plays for the Chiefs and his daughter is a student athlete at Oklahoma currently.

It sounds like he was stalked by the man who committed the murder. Flights were delayed for about three hours. And all flights out of Oklahoma City are canceled for the day. This is crazy. Someone needs to do something about guns and how  did someone get a gun inside an airport? It seems unfathomable to me that they got in there with a gun and all the security. It takes me forever to get through the TSA checkpoints on a good day!"	66	1	6	1	48	140000	2	test	52

It was at least releaving to know that it was only one person this time and not a mass shooting like so many others we so often hear about.

Sories like this one really make me glad that I live in America. I couldnt imagine having to worry about being bombed in my everyday life.

1120	15	It's hard to fathom the pain and suffering that the people of Yemen have endured over the past years. The constant fighting, airstrikes, and shelling have caused immense harm and forced millions to flee their homes. It's especially tragic that those who were supposed to be protected in prisons were instead targeted and killed. It's also difficult to reconcile the justifications given by the Saudi-led coalition for these airstrikes. The claim that the security complex was being used as a command and control center by the Houthis may seem plausible, but it does not excuse the loss of civilian life. The repeated bombing of civilian targets, such as the funeral hall in Sanaa, is not only tragic but also a violation of international humanitarian law.	70	2	4	1	50	30000	1	test	57
1121	15	I feel bad for the prisoners who had nothing to do with the Hodeidah. I also wish for peace in Yemen. Yemen has so many amazing individuals and it has been ravaged by war. The civilians are at great risk living there and I feel really bad for them. On one hand though I understand why the airstrikes need to occur. It just sucks when bombings occur that take out innocent civilians. 	69	1	7	1	27	59000	2	test	58

I'm no military strategist so I have no claim to know how to fight the terrorist while also minimizing casualties. There's also the part of me that wonders if the civilians knew about the terrorists, in which case that's on them.	49	1	6	1	37	12000	1	test	62
1196	6	I think Almost all foreign combat troops withdrew at the end of 2014, leaving Afghan troops facing an aggressive Taliban militia. Pajhwok Afghan News quoted a farmer in Kunduz named Taza Gul as saying for was working on my farm when the bombardment started. On coming home, I saw seven members of my family, including women and children, killed in the raids. After the deadly 2015 airstrike in Kunduz, a U.S. military investigation led to the disciplining of 16 military members who were said to have made mistakes leading to the strike. Doctors Without Borders called the attack a war crime. Also it is the big crime rate for ever lasting. Thus the US troop make the peaceful life style for all the civilization for every situation.	51	2	7	1	52	70000	2	test	63

Jordan is a close ally of the US but in this case, it seems like there was an exchange of gunfire after the driver ignored demands to stop outside the airbase. I felt like there was a misunderstanding somewhere but I am not sure. I feel conflicted about this event.	67	2	7	5	31	100000	2	test	64

1199	7	Hey so this is kind of confusing. We are there helping their troops fight syria yet then shoot at our people and injure / kill them. Then the united states just believes this is how it happened  and fully supports Jordan’s investigation. Shouldn’t we be performing our own investigation into what happened. Why were they shooting at out forces. We are putting our men in danger with them now knowing they can shoot our people and we won’t investigate it. 	58	2	5	1	28	50000	1	test	66
1199	7	I think it's too bad that this happened but it sounds like the Americans were doing something inexplicable, or ill advised, or something.  I'm sure they knew they needed to stop at the checkpoint and they didn't.  The Jordanian guys had little choice but to do their jobs, especially in light of the heightened concern over terrorism with Syria.  I'm sure a lot of people are irate, or even thinking it was some sort of terrorist thing from Jordanians who resent America, or maybe that the Jordanian military has been infiltrated by bad guys.  It's all possible, but war is ugly.  When you put on a uniform you run the risk of getting shot by someone.  If this was bad guys hopefully they string them up.  Otherwise it was an unfortunate incident.	60	1	6	1	45	21000	2	test	67
1202	7	It was an accident. If everything was done properly then nothing would have happened. You can't be lackadaisical at a military base in a foreign country.

It appears that the incident occurred when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base, and an exchange of gunfire took place. It's heartbreaking to hear about the loss of life, and my thoughts go out to the families of those who were killed.

The article mentions that the incident was not terrorism-related, and both U.S. and Jordanian authorities are investigating the cause. It's worth noting that Jordan is a close ally of the United States, and military training by U.S. personnel is common in the country. There are over 1,000 U.S. military personnel based in Jordan, many of whom serve as advisers to Jordan's armed forces and Sy"	56	2	6	1	64	100000	2	test	69
1145	16	"I just read an article about the dire situation in Aleppo, and it's left me feeling heartbroken and hopeless for the people caught in the conflict. The Syrian government has sent a text message warning residents of a ""strategically planned assault"" within 24 hours, while Russian warplanes continue to back the regime with airstrikes. The lack of aid and supplies in the area is also concerning, with reports of residents running out of food and markets being empty. It's difficult to comprehend the complexities of the situation and the suffering of innocent people caught in the crossfire. My thoughts are with the people of Aleppo, and I hope for a peaceful resolution to this devastating conflict."	112	1	4	1	40	35000	1	test	70
1145	16	I feel sad about the article because the good people of Syria have been under siege for many years now and they continue to be in peril. The article made me feel dismayed because of the turmoil that the Syrians were having to experience. The food shortages and price increases also made me sad because that is a large version of what has been happening in the USA in recent years. I felt a sense of guilt when reading the passage because the USA military and government is also involved in harming the innocent citizens of Syria for several years now. 	113	1	4	1	53	10000	2	test	71
1144	16	I just don't know what to tell you about Syria.  I don't understand what the war is all about but it sounds like a complete disaster with so many people dying and living in fear. No food or meat is affordable if it can be found and now the people in Aleppo are being told to leave quickly as there is going to strikes.  They need so much help and Russia is helping to destroy the country if I understand correctly.  Very scary to think this is happening in our world right now. 	111	2	2	1	39	95000	2	test	72
1144	16	My first thought is Syria are terrorists how many terrorist organizations have came out of Syria that was just the first thing that popped into my head. And Benghazi. That was tragic I know it wasn't in the article but is it just the first thing that popped in my head sometimes I just can't get past stuff like that because that was just messed up, the ambassador was killed ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith Tyrone Woods Glen Daugtry but back to the article I think it would be an awful place to live to be honest it just sounds like a real crap hole to live I'm sorry I know it's not directly relating to the article but It is.	61	2	2	1	44	21000	1	test	73
1150	16	I read a very upsetting article about the people of Syria and the hardships they are going through due to the warzone they are living in the midst of. It made me think that our peaceful lives could be ended very quickly if society here in the US were to break down, and it made me fearful for the future, as society becomes ever more politically and demographically fractured. The future looks bleak I fear, but I hope that I am wrong of course.	72	1	6	1	53	90000	2	test	74
1150	16	That the overall situation is very tragic, the fact that they are getting bombed and to be told they only have 24 hours to evacuate sends chills down my spine. I also found it worrying that the refugees don't have anywhere else to go. The fact that there is fighter jets just ready to bomb the city, is insane. The fact that Russia is helping them also doesn't surprise me at all, and the fact that there has been not help for the Eastern Aleppo and people are starving, part of me wishes that there was something that could be done.	119	1	4	2	24	110000	1	test	75
1163	17	I just read a rather sad article. It was discussing how elderly Syrians have been affected with the war. It focused on some points that I hadn't considered, like how many of them are abandoned as their kids and grandkids flee the country. It also commented on how their chronic health issues can't be attended to because of more emergency situation. It was depressing to read and I felt so sorry for them.	131	2	6	1	38	39000	2	test	76
1163	17	I just read about what is going on in Syria in Aleppo and it's horrible. I would hate to live in a place that is an active warzone -- too many people are suffering and dying over there right now and I just wish I could so something about it, but I know I can't. It makes me feel powerless knowing how much people are suffering and all I can do is sit back and watch. Hopefully the US or the UN will step in and help with this horrible situation. Nobody should have to starve to death or be killed in a pointless war like this.	130	1	2	1	30	36000	1	test	77
1164	17	I feel sad and distressed when I think about the long-term turmoil that the citizens of Syria have had to endure for several years during a war that the USA is part of fighting. The family mentioned in the article is obviously enduring hardships they would not have had to endure if Syria was not being attacked by outside forces for unjust reasons. It seems like the family in the article is slowly being exterminated. It makes me wonder if the war on Syria is part of the overall global depopulation program that is taking place under the direction of entities such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization.	113	1	4	1	53	10000	2	test	78
1164	17	It's heartbreaking to know how families are struggling because of war. The most vulnerable populations are overlooked and not considered when it comes to escaping these broken nations. Have you heard about the war in Syria and other wars happening around the world? If only there were something we could do to help those in crisis.  It's not unrealistic to think that our own country could end up at war with another nation. Honestly, what would we do? 	132	2	6	3	36	87000	1	test	79
1170	17	This was a glimpse into life in Aleppo that I didn't expect to encounter today. We think about these conflicts as being very far away and they do not touch us here in the United States even when our government has been and/or continues to be involved. Syria is so challenging with the rebel situation and the current government in place. It's so frustrating to hear about people living under these dire conditions. This particular story hit me harder because it talked about people having to flee and leave their elderly parents and relatives behind. How do people survive in these situations at a time in their lives where they need greater assistance from family and the community? In this particular family situation, it sounds like the kids didn't leave but there is till immense need.	136	1	6	1	54	84000	2	test	80

1172	18	Hey check out this article. It explains how polar bears are facing shorter and shorter ice seasons. I didn't even know that wasa  thing but I learned they use it for everything, housing, transportation and means to hunt. They are such noble creatures so this bums me out.

1172	18	It is always so sad to read articles that detail the negative consequences of climate change and how humans and animals are being effected.  The data is very clear that the situation has been getting worse and will continue to get worse until we make drastic measures. What we have done to combat climate change is very, very small and we have moved very slowly.  We need to make climate change our number one priority, and do absolutely all we can, otherwise humans and animals will die. 	73	2	7	1	57	104000	1	test	83
1175	18	Can you believe we are on the way to wiping out polar bears? I was reading today that ice is melting faster and that the cold seasons are even getting shorter! Another thing I read is that there are less that 30,000 polar bears left in the world. It is such a shame that we have done this to the world for nothing other than greed. The beauty of this world is in extreme jeopardy and I feel powerless to stop it. Paper straws will only do so much, huge companies need to be held accountable.	108	2	4	1	44	20000	2	test	84
1175	18	I think this is a very sad situation all around. I wish there were more things that we as humans could do to prevent these things from happening but for the most part I feel it is out of our control. I feel that what God sees fit to be will be no mmatter how it makes us think or feel. I also kinda thnk that this is something that is happening slowly over a very long period of time. With that being said, I don't think this will have a big impact on the population for many more years.	38	2	2	1	41	25000	1	test	85
1174	18	Hey, have you heard about the new study on polar bears and sea ice? It's really concerning. The study shows that polar bears across the Arctic are facing a shorter sea ice season due to earlier spring ice melt and later ice growth in the fall. This loss of sea ice habitat could have a significant negative impact on their feeding and breeding capabilities. As someone who cares about the environment and the well-being of animals, I find this news really upsetting. It's a reminder of the urgent need to take action on climate change.	122	1	6	1	32	152500	1	test	86
1174	18	If the article I read is true, then there is a worrying trend with regard to polar bears. The article told me that there is a rather large decrease in the amount of good ice habitat available each year for polar bears. This seems like it would make it much more difficult for polar bears to survive and may lead to the dwindling of their species. That's just my assumption though based on the article stating that data from the past 30 years has shown that ice starts melting faster in the Spring in polar regions and it takes longer to freeze again in the Fall.	139	1	6	1	34	45000	2	test	87
1171	18	I don't care about polar bears in any sort of emotional sense.  They're just another species that didn't exist for billions of years and now has existed for the blink of an eye, and weepy, weak, ignorant people are going to think that the universe lost something indelible when the polar bears die out.  It's all ephemeral, people.  However, I'm interested in and academic sense in seeing how polar bears respond.  Life doesn't just roll over and die.  It, uh, uh, finds a way.  So while the polar bears' ice is retreating and showing up later and going away sooner, I have to imagine that the 19 groups of polar bears will adapt in some way.  I'm curious to see how that is.  Again, I can't imagine life has lasted as long as it has by just accepting its fate and keeling over when climate changes.	60	1	6	1	45	21000	2	test	88
1171	18	The overall season shift in the Arctic could be a large deal coming up. Possibly the effects are just now beginning to be seen. It is also possible that this data is negligible. Perhaps a season could shift in natural ways or alternates based on irregularities of the Earth's spin. The idea is cause for concern.	137	1	6	6	30	100000	1	test	89
1173	18	"Hi friend

I just read this really sad article about Polar bears loosing the ability to hunt and survive in their natural habitat.

1173	18	The article said there were 19 separate polar bear populations that live throughout the Arctic and talked about the Arctic sea ice melting and that's where the polar bears hunt and mate. As to my emotions thoughts and feelings about it. Honestly kind of hard to explain because I read it as they were facts and I do think it's rather sad that the arctic sea ice is melting and that's where the polar bears use and I do a lot of activities like hunting and stuff but the rest of the article to me the way I read it stated information so what kind of emotions am I supposed to have about it? Unless it was more or less referring to climate change I could see it that way too I guess. 	61	2	2	1	44	21000	2	test	91
1179	18	global warming is a really important issue that we need to discuss and find ways of slowing it down drastically.

1183	19	It is very sad. That poor guy has had a rough life. There is no way he should be deported. All of the other details about his life were irrelevant. He should have been made a citizen when he was adopted. The fact that it wasn't the law already is shameful. How was he supposed to live? How was he even legally adopted if not a citizen?	49	1	6	1	37	12000	2	test	94
1183	19	Check out this story. It is an outrage that something like this could happen in the United States. This person was wronged by so many institutions that should have been protecting him. An abusive couple should never have been allowed to adopt a child in the first place. The foster families as well as a second adoptive family were also abusive. Obviously there need to be some major changes to the adoption system in this country. We need to do a better job protecting our children. Any child brought into this country and adopted by United States citizens should become a citizen. A child has no say and does not ask to be removed from their home country. An adoption should provide a better life, not lead to abuse. We need to protect future children from ending up in the same situation.	143	2	6	1	42	50000	1	test	95
1184	19	"I just read a story about a person who was brought to our country when he was 3, over 30 years ago. He was adopted into an abusive family, then fostered by another which was equally abusive. He has had a troubled life, and spent time in jail, but has married and seemingly turned his life around over the last few years. He recently applied for a green card, and of course his background check showed all his troubles. That makes him eligible for deportation, and that is what will happen, if it hasn't already. He will leave his wife and family and his home for a country that will be alien to him, and where he will be a total stanger.
It seems to me that we have chosen to do things, not because it is right, but because we are afraid of what we can't control, and so control those we can."	145	1	4	1	63	55000	2	test	96
1184	19	I just read this article and it's really messed up. Some people had adopted a Korean boy and brought him way over the the US. They abused him and his sister and they both were split up in the foster care system. This boy was adopted, abused, and abandoned many times. Now that he has a family of his own, they are trying to deport him. It's basically stuff he was sort of forced to do while he was being oppressed, like stealing his stuff back and owning a gun for protection. That ain't even the worst part. None of the people who adopted him registered him to become a citizen. Sometimes Americans are a special type of evil, girl.	144	2	6	3	31	36000	1	test	97
1190	19	I just read about a man who is being deported due to his citizenship status. It's really a sad story -- this man is 41 and has a family of his own, but because his adoptive parents didn't file the proper paperwork on him, he wasn't classified as a US citizen and now he's being deported. His family is going to be torn apart, which is horrible -- it's not just affecting this man, but his family as well. It just seems unnecessarily cruel to do this to him when he wasn't at fault for this situation to being with. I feel like an exception should be made for him.	130	1	2	1	30	36000	2	test	98
1190	19	I feel very sorry for the individual in this article, Adam Crapser, as he should have received U.S. citizenship as part of the adoption process.   It is unfair to deport him now as he has his own family in the U.S.   There should be some criteria to protect him as a result of the mistakes and lack of controls in place when he was a child going through the adoption system.   I hope that this article brought some attention to his case and that a more informed decision was made with regard to his future.	149	1	7	1	56	275000	1	test	99
