She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed.

36	58	I had never considered the zoos in countries like Venezuela. I'm concerned that it seems like they're being fined and punished for their predicament. I think other zoos throughout the world should step up and try to rescue the animals, or at the very least, preserve them for a scientific purpose and euthanize them humanely. Those that are endangered should be removed. It's just a terrible situation for everyone, but the zoo owners and animals aren't at fault, it's the political constraints.	5.833333333333333	6.125	45	2	6	1	31	34999	6.5	7.0	2.0	3.5	4.0	4.286	2.857	5.0	4.571	1	train	35	Neutral

The zoo animals should be slaughtered to feed people.  The horses slaughtered to feed to animals should be fed to people.  The animals probably shouldn't be in zoos to begin with, but now that they are they shouldn't come before human needs.  That's idiotic.  Just butcher the zoo animals, feed them to people, and be done with the problem.

The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status.

Polar bears haven't existed for like 99.9999% of the history of the universe, and now we think it's some travesty that they won't exist in the future.

Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way.  Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people?

62	150	I just read a story about the death of a Chinese female fighter pilot. It wasn't made clear exactly what happened - apart from a plane crash - but she is being hailed a hero. I was amazed that China would allow women to hold that kind of position - shockingly modern of them. And that she was widely respected warms my heart.	3.333333333333333	1.0	27	2	7	1	46	41000	4.5	7.0	3.0	6.0	1.0	4.286	2.857	4.857	5.0	1	train	61	Neutral

64	150	I just read an article about China's Yu Xu. She was one of the first female fighter pilots cleared for a solo flight. The state run media is very tight lipped about the cause of the accident and the comments attributed to Yu seem very sterile and highly suspect. She was even compared to Mulan at the end of the article. I just don't know about communist governments. The whole thing seemed like lip service to mask a technical failure.	4.333333333333333	2.0	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	63	Neutral

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman.

In today's world, anyone should be able to do anything and their freedom should not be restricted.	1.0	1.625	17	1	6	1	29	85000	6.75	6.75	6.75	6.75	7.0	4.643	2.0715	4.143	4.643	1	train	178	Anger
181	305	Wow, a twelve year old russian girl commited suicide because of her association with some website that promoted teens committing suicide.  It's really sad that sick people would go online and prey on little children like this.  I find it shocking and hard to believe anyone would want to do such a thing.  They really need to find a way to crack down on these people and put them away for life.  This is just ridiculous.	2.5	1.25	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	180	Sadness
182	305	I just read an article about suicides in Russia. Apparently, there are online communities devoted to encouraging teenagers to take their own lives. Often times these websites are maintained and propagated just to receive money through advertising. Can you imagine living with the deaths of people just to make a few bucks from ads? We truly live in a twisted reality.	3.8333333333333335	2.625	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	181	Neutral
183	305	It's a day like any other day in a provincial city in central Russia. A 12-year-old girl is getting ready to go to school. Suddenly her phone rings. The next minute she is out of the door, saying she's meeting a friend and they will go to school together. Later the same day, when her mother turns up at the school, there is no sign of her daughter. No-one has seen her. This is really sad and terrifying.	6.0	2.0	5	2	6	3	22	100000	5.5	4.5	3.5	6.0	6.0	3.714	2.857	2.571	3.429	1	train	182	Sadness
184	305	It is quite disturbing that the number of teen suicides in Russia is so high. It is far less surprising that there is a direct link between the increase in suicides and the Russian social media site VKontakte. I think there is a causal link between teen suicides in the US and the growing popularity of similar sites.	2.0	1.0	35	1	6	3	33	64000	6.5	7.0	3.5	4.5	7.0	3.714	1.0	2.429	1.429	1	train	183	Neutral
185	305	I just read an article about a teenage girl in Russia who was apparently taken in by an online suicide group that conditions teens to kill themselves. It's odd to think that there are people out there that get off on convincing impressionable youth to commit suicide. I think the internet is becoming something that guardians need to at least passively monitor to see what's going on in their children's heads.	5.666666666666667	5.25	25	1	4	1	29	39000	6.0	6.5	1.0	6.0	5.5	5.0	2.286	3.286	4.143	1	train	184	Neutral
186	299	I think it's sad that so much plastic in the ocean is affecting wildlife the way it is.  It's really unfair the way we have destroyed their ecosystem with our own selfish use of plastic.  It is terrible when you see pictures of all the plastic in the ocean.  Apparently these birds are even being tricked into thinking plastic is food since it smells like food to them.  That is so unnatural and just wrong really.  and all this has happened in just a short period of time!	1.0	1.125	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	185	Sadness

I just can't stand birds.  So the idea that they're so stupid they'll keep eating plastic and threaten their species' very existence, is amusing to me.  I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much.  I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean.  That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point.  We're not the problem.

189	299	Hey, I just read this article that I want to tell you about. Apparently, seabirds are eating plastic because plastic emits a scent that it similar to food. Plastic in the ocean gets coated with algae which emits a sulfur smell that some seabirds love. Pretty crazy, right? Anyway, it's sad what we're doing to our environment. It's sadder that we are pretty powerless to do anything about it. It's only a matter of time before everything justs collapses on itself.

195	313	This is something that is hard to choose sides with.  When people seek asylum its fine to want to help.

196	398	I think it's sad that the golden eagles are being killed by manmade technology.  It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.  This is just one of many similar examples anyway.	1.3333333333333333	1.125	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	195	Sadness
197	398	To me this is a hard story to think about. First thing I think about when I hear wind turbines is clean and green power, which in my opinion is a good thing.

200	398	I completely agree with the findings in this article. I think that these companies need to look at the big picture of animal life being killed. They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	1	train	199	Neutral
202	31	I'm mostly bothered by this story because of how much it demonstrates our inability to do anything about these large issues.  Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do.  Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to.  I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess.  I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.  But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?	1.5	3.5	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	201	Disgust/Sadness
203	31	We must do something to stop these companies from getting rid of what forest and animals we have left. The fact that orangutans are an endagered species angers me.

What we need to do is all come together and work towards the same goal.	6.0	6.375	19	1	6	2	32	35000	5.5	5.0	2.0	5.5	4.5	3.429	2.857	2.857	2.714	1	train	202	Anger

207	201	This whole issue is bullshit.  Blacks get killed by cops less frequently than whites based on encounter rates.  The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.  And yet the truth never comes out, just the narrative that blacks are being murdered by law enforcement.

For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.

The frog population his been effected by urban garden ponds and people moving frogs from pond to pond. The frogs do not seem to be recovering from the diseases that is spreading.

On the other hand, why wait twenty years to bring up an incident that happened that was that disturbing?  I think some women are making allegations and accusations just to get attention or for political motivations.  Who knows why.  People do crazy things for crazy reasons.  I'm just really skeptical of a lot of these things I hear and I think the #metoo movement has gotten way out of hand.

I assume this woman has something wrong with her.  She's not that old and I have to believe something's wrong with her to be out like that.  Dementia or mental illness or something.  Anyway, it's got to be really hard to take care of someone like that.  Our ability to live a long time is a double-edged sword.  Our bodies keep working and our minds stop, or vice versa, I guess.  Anyway, I feel sad if some family is worrying about where this woman is.  She might be scared and confused too.	3.8333333333333335	3.375	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	235	Sadness
237	245	So, I just read an article about an old woman who seemed to be suffering from dementia found wandering without a coat in the northeast.

238	245	This is a sad case of what seems like an elderly woman getting lost.  I feel sad for the family involved and the feelings they must have.  Or did they even notice she was gone?  You would think they would be out looking for her if they noticed.  Maybe it was just a lonely old woman by herself which is even more sad.  Either way, I feel like elderly people in general are often overlooked and that is unfortunate.  They should deserve the same respect that younger people do  	2.1666666666666665	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	237	Sadness
239	245	Its a good thing the cops are asking for help because I dont feel like anyone else would at this point. The fact that the woman was found wandering in the middle of the night without a coat is scary. It also goes to show that most people do not help others.

I hope my parents don't decline that much as they age but they possibly will.

But I fear the state of our country and the world when these people invade and infest good countries.  The weak and bad infect the good, and too many countries, like Germany, are allowing it to happen.

She had a productive life.	5.666666666666667	2.5	7	1	2	5	29	44000	5.5	6.0	4.5	6.0	5.0	3.714	3.0	3.429	3.429	1	train	245	Neutral/Sadness
247	177	I remember reading about her growing up during the Bush era. She seemed to be a rude person with that whole Elian Gonzales saga. However we must pay our respects every time somebody dies.

248	177	I don't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for Janet Reno or anyone who knew her, but I vividly remember many of the issues she dealt with and so she represents a part of my past.  i guess I found this story nostalgic more than anything.  Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.	2.333333333333333	1.0	48	1	6	1	41	28000	2.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	1.0	3.286	4.429	2.714	2.571	1	train	247	Neutral

I would blame social media and the way people spread information now.  Plus a general anger that has entered society and people feel it is acceptable to take it out in violence against others.   	1.0	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	271	Neutral

These hate crimes have not only risen in muslims but also other minorities if you look closely at the news. I feel like more needs to be done to fix this.

But it's not because of communist corruption.  Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live?  Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all?  Who will watch the watchmen?  It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate.

322	52	I am not sure how I feel about this.  This guy is a lifelong criminal and honestly I don't think people like that deserve citizenship.  His parents messed up when he was young, yes, but he could have taken the responsibility to fix that as an adult.  He should have looked into it instead of spending so much time and energy breaking the law.  So I think he deserves what he is getting and should have been more careful.  	1.0	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	1	train	321	Neutral

They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up.

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.

205	31	I just read this article about the exploitation of Orangutan habitat in Indonesia and it is alarming. Orangutan are not just any animals, they are one of the smartest and closely related to us. I am sure, you would have watched some documentary where it is shown how evolved they are as a society and how familiar they look to us when caring for their children for instance. It is just so sad that this is happening and I wish we as a race would show more empathy and concern for these magnificent creatures.	5.5	4.25	28	1	6	5	34	36000	6.0	3.5	2.0	7.0	6.0	4.857	2.571	2.143	4.571	2	train	704	Sadness
206	201	This type of situation really makes my blood boil.  Who do these people think they are, going out in the streets and looting like a bunch of wild animals in order to protest?  The guy was shot!  He was a clear threat to the officers and had PCP in his car.  This is ridiculous.  The officer felt he had to protect himself.  What gives people the right to then go out and loot and act like a bunch of wild animals and get more people killed in response?  How on earth is that a mature response to the situation?

We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people. We don't hear all the stories about officers being shot every day. We don't see riots and protests when another cop is shot by a supposedly unarmed suspect.

I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours.  The government took extra power to increase safety.  People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.  The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing.  how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show.

221	417	I have mixed feelings about this story, for sure.  On the one hand, I feel sad for the woman who lost her dog.  I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her.  Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult.  This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.

I know we always or mostly mean well but this story amply displayed how when we interfere with natural order of things even with the best of intentions, we can make the matters worse.

I did find it sad that these frogs and other wildlife are dying and possibly suffering from this disease that people are causing by being careless.

No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?

And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again.

It is just ridiculous.  You can't tell me it's not harmful for a child to run through a cloud of smoke.  On the same token, I thought the argument that it was setting a bad example was stupid.  Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life.  It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.	1.0	1.0	24	2	7	1	38	42000	7.0	3.5	6.5	5.5	6.5	3.429	2.714	2.571	3.857	2	train	845	Anger

I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public.  Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants?  Or is that ""normal"" and ""okay,"" while smoking isn't for some reason.  This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	849	Neutral

This is such a sad scenario that people see killing others as an outlet for their own negative emotions.

They need to have a meeting with leaders and figure things out diplomatically. I think war is just to tossed around over there when you have innocent victims and civilians being killed. They need to do things like trump be firm and have sanctions build walls but dont rely on iolence to get your way. The fact that the cease fire was broken and both sides have nuclear weapons scares me, that there is no line that they can not cross or break.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	949	Fear/Sadness

Those people exist and aren't all that rare, so this type of thing doesn't totally surprise me, although it's still disturbing and chilling.  However, the tone of this article and these people is absurd.  They want equality for all living things.  So, what, that means I'll be charged with murder if I swat a fly?  If a dog kills a child they'll be arrested, read their Miranda rights and be appointed an attorney?  People are stupid.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	952	Sadness

I can understand with the jordian people being on high alert with syrian suicide bombers attacking them earlier.

But this just is not the case people need to be open and see he is actually helping many diverse communities and make us be one instead of dividing and hating.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness.

I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting.  Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully.

There have been known instances where Russia has attempted to kill people they did not want to release information.	3.1666666666666665	6.375	16	2	5	1	28	50000	6.0	6.0	5.0	4.5	3.5	5.0	4.143	4.857	5.0	2	train	995	Neutral
498	103	The death of a former aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin was recently ruled accidental. The aide was found in a hotel room in Washington DC and had suffered head injuries related to an accidental fall following days of heavy and excessive drinking. The hotel was the Dupont Circle Hotel which is an upscale hotel.	6.0	2.0	43	2	6	1	33	110000	7.0	4.5	1.5	7.0	7.0	4.286	1.286	3.857	4.0	2	train	997	Neutral
499	103	Everything about Russia really freaks me out. I think this country really needs to be cut off until they can be a more peaceful society. It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up. People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world. He has way to much power in my belief and needs to be over thrown. 	6.0	6.0	53	2	3	1	27	25000	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	6.0	4.0	2.286	3.571	3.714	2	train	998	Fear
500	103	Whenever Russia and Putin are involved  I do not trust what is being said. The story about him being drunk and drinking all day sounds weird. I do not see how he falls and hits his head and then falls over and over causing harm all over his body. I think they was killed, but I do not know why. I feel bad for his family.	1.5	4.875	30	1	6	3	37	40000	7.0	5.5	1.0	6.5	6.0	4.857	2.0	3.429	5.0	2	train	999	Sadness
