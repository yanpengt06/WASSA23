I think lives could be saved if people would be a little more attentive to things like this.",

She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.",

The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports.

The zoo wasn't even targeted in attacks on the area. I'm not a big fan of zoos in the first place, but it is nice to know that there are groups out there to look out for the best interest of these poor animals.",

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.",

Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do. Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to. I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess. I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad. But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?",

This whole movement was also based on a complete lie. The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit. That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

How anyone can bang on the door of another country and expect anything is beyond me. They have no right to that. This refugee issue is going to get more problematic and I think it behooves non crappy countries to decide, well in advance, what they're going to do about mass refugee groups, how many they'll take, etc. you can't wait until they're ther",

I don't see a simple fix here. It's easy to sit there and judge and say this is unfair, but also what is everyone supposed to do?

They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US.

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations. Lina was left in that car for 38 hours. Can you believe this? This deeply disturbs me. How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours? Just unbelievable. The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand. I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals. It's infuriating. No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day. (",

A little more background about why they were out there shooting wolves might have been helpful, like maybe there was a valid reason. Wolves can be harmful creatures.",

I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy.

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere. And this event probably really did happen. But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter. And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.",

With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

In front of her children and family. Maybe she was just worried the arrest was not suppose to happen, you should not be able to become violent out of anger.",

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons. But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion. Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause. The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump. Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back. Welcome to it.",

Both the people and the elephants are being hit the hardest, not to mention the forests that are being destroyed. There have been 75 deaths of people and 30 deaths of elephants. People are having respiratory problems. Just imagine the children being affected. It's a travesty. People need clean air and water to live and it's like the government doesn't care. Someone needs to step up and do something.",

Because there is no technical \"war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return.

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much. And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds. These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way. However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions. It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it? How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something. I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms. Do we understand that? Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms? I'm sure no one understands that either.",

I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours. The government took extra power to increase safety. People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off. The nation grieved. Sounds a lot like America after 9/11. We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond). The French aren't quite as bold. The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing. how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show. Awful to live with.",

This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered. However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs. I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs. People are killed by dogs. Dogs are weapons, too. No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog? Yes.

I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters. No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic). But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid. Are women not stronger than that? Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning? Men go after women and always will. There are repercussions for women wanting it all. Sorry.",

I am sorry just in a general sense because the loss of a life is always a sad thing and I'm sad for the family members who were left behind to grieve her loss.

Why were the villagers so upset? Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on? Also, who called for the helicopter?

Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life. It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.",

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me. I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public. Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants? Or is that \"normal\" and \"okay,\" while smoking isn't for some reason. This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism. These people have gone too far in trying to control things and bully legal things out of existence. It angers me.",

I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.",

In one brief moment the world goes from visible to invisible in an instant. It's got to be nearly traumatic (although she seems to be remaining upbeat). But I also don't feel that much sympathy because I want to know what she was doing when it happened. Kashmir is a violent place. Someone like this should not be ignorant of the dangers in the region, including how police will respond to protests and uprisings. I'm sure she wasn't just sitting in a peaceful cafe, minding her own business when she got blasted. If she was part of a riot, then she got what she could have expected. If she wasn't part of the unrest, then she should have fled the area.",

I can understand that protests can become unsafe or even violent so you need tactics to over come that but with such numbers of people getting very hurt and permanently disabled I think thye should change there tactics.

The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats. Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats? For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN? Screw that.",

I feel like theres so many different levels to these happenings and something has to be done on each to prevent little children from getting these pills in there hands. On the level of the manufactorers we need to have way better packaging like codes the kids cant get into. Doctors prescribing these should ask if they have kids and tell them preventetive measures that should be taken to reduce the risk of exposure. Parents need to have a better understanding how easy it is for kids to get into these and die. So senseless dying of something so easy to prevent.",

Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood. Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it. And believe me, I understand \"sport.\" But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.

It is scary that these animals were never known to carry this disease and now they do and I wonder if somewhere someone mutated there genes and now there are many out there spreading the disease. It is so sad these little guys much be in so much pain at the end and theres nothing they can do to alleviate it. I hope somehow they do more research to find some way to stop the spread of it before the whole species goes extinct. I feel grateful this conservationist is the one who noticed and gained more attention for the cause as other people came forward witht the same concerns.",

I can't imagine the dread that must have come over people as each sway became more pronounced. Terrifying.",

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating. They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen. I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays. Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves. I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it. But I still don't understand it. Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.",

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.",

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness. Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon.",
