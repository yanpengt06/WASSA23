It's utterly dreadful that humans can intentionally cause harm to innocent animals and still have a good night's sleep. In my opinion, people should not even be in close proximity to polar bears. These creatures deserve to be left alone in their natural habitat.",

        "essay": "Upon learning about the suffering inflicted upon the people of Venezuela, especially the children who are left famished and bewildered, my heart overflows with compassion. However, my emotional response quickly changes when I ponder the underlying causes of this situation. The country possesses vast wealth from its oil reserves but has been stripped of its resources due to the corrupt practices of communism. My anger and disgust are directed towards the centralized government that perpetuates an environment that only benefits a select group of treacherous officials. The inherent flaws within such a governing system rapidly give way to corruption and abuse, as is evident in the current catastrophic situation in Venezuela. A decentralized system is more transparent as it ensures accountability for those in power, making it easier to prevent them from committing misdeeds. I deeply regret that this crisis in Venezuela is not limited to its borders, but has become a global concern of our own.",

In my view, these individuals are hardly civilized and it doesn't matter whether the Houthis or civilians become casualties. Those who behave immorally deserve what they get. I understand that the Houthis have constitutional support from Iran, but I'm clearly in favor of the coalition because this is essentially a battle between Iran and those who are relatively better than them (which, let's be real, isn't saying much). However, I believe that if one is to go to war, they should be prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve victory. This includes the killing of civilians. If your intention isn't to win, why even bother? And in the case of Yemen, rather than merely meddling, we should annihilate the entire country and allow the rightful government to restore order.",

The sheer notion that any parent would intentionally subject their children to toxic substances is simply unfathomable, showcasing a complete disregard for the wellbeing of their loved ones. This callous behavior represents a complete dereliction of responsibility, as parents are morally obligated to protect their children from harm. It is crucial for parents to take preemptive measures to prevent their children from accessing dangerous drugs, and remain vigilant to identify any potential risks that may imperil their safety. The agony and trauma endured by these young children owing to the irresponsibility and negligence of others is intolerable and must not be condoned.",

Such incidents are prevalent in our culture, and it's disheartening to read about them. It's upsetting to consider that people like Cook could roam free for an extended period, hurting and traumatizing innocent individuals.

If you want to win, you have to fight dirty and fight hard. World War 2 wasn't won by 'playing nice' – we had to resort to nuclear weapons and level Germany. Civilians are an inevitable part of the equation. In Yemen, the decision to allow rebel groups supported by Iran to take over has put innocent citizens in danger and resulted in threats to Saudi Arabia. The notion that the Saudis should prioritize protecting the Yemeni over their own citizens is ridiculous. They should fight with everything they have, regardless of the consequences. Winning the war is what matters, not sparing people's feelings. This kind of naive thinking is dangerous.",

To discover that such atrocities are still occurring in our contemporary world is truly disheartening. The reality that certain nations must send in troops to aid others is a sorrowful indication that our society is not quite as progressive as we may have believed. The recent decision made by Kenya to extradite an official and knowingly place their life in peril if returned to Sudan left me appalled. This cruel and detestable action can only be described as a tragedy, and Kenya should feel ashamed for their involvement in this situation.",

Her decision to allow her unleashed dog to freely run in the park posed a clear threat to the public. Despite the man's repeated requests and warning, the woman still ignored his pleas. The sight of dogs running unrestrained and causing harm to innocent individuals triggers anger within me.

The article blames Trump for any wrongdoing against Israel, yet this accusation is unfounded. In actuality, Trump has been a strong supporter of Israel, unlike his predecessor Obama, who not only failed to aid Israel but even formed an alliance with its sworn enemy, Iran. It is unjust to hold Trump responsible for any increase in anti-Semitic sentiment. Instead, he is merely a reflection of the necessary cultural changes that have been long overdue. The 2016 pushback from white men can be attributed to the constant bombardment of the LGBTQ+ community, minorities, and women. Our issues surpass Trump's presidency, and we must tackle them accordingly. Thus, I welcome you to the resistance.",

One participant, in particular, expressed an exhaustion with the recurrent pattern of violence, specifically in cases where a police officer uses force and it suddenly becomes acceptable for others to respond with violence or looting. The individual observed a trend where society immediately places all blame on officers without waiting for all the facts, painting them as looking for any chance to use force. The person felt that the public doesn't react the same way when officers themselves are attacked. It's high time to afford both sides of the situation a fair representation.",

It is beyond unacceptable to subject wildlife to such deplorable conditions, especially when we have humans living on the streets struggling to survive. It is clear that our society is to blame for the suffering inflicted upon both animals and humans. Our selfish and thoughtless actions have resulted in the imposition of sanctions upon other nations, effectively branding ourselves as the bullies of the world who demand obedience or else face the consequences of our wrath. It is high time that we take responsibility for our actions and begin making the changes necessary to rectify the damage done.",

Sadly, not enough voices within the Muslim community condemn such actions or work to prevent them, whether it's at home or abroad.

The fact that some countries need to send troops to help others is a sad indication that our society isn't as progressive as we might want to think. I was utterly shocked by Kenya's recent move to extradite an official, knowing full well that the person would be at risk of death if returned to Sudan. This heartless and despicable act is nothing short of a tragedy, and Kenya ought to be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this situation.",

Although it's necessary to prevent terrorist activities from harming the country, forcibly evicting an entire Muslim community is an extreme and unfair measure.

While providing aid and support to Burma is essential, it should not be at the expense of mistreating innocent people. It's imperative that we find solutions that prioritize the well-being and respect of all individuals involved.",

It's truly heartbreaking to read about the horrors that occurred and it evokes a deep sense of sorrow for the current state of our world. Prior to this incident, I held the belief that individuals held a mixture of good and bad, but this atrocity has caused me to re-think my viewpoint. It's revolting and unacceptable that someone or a group could commit such a heinous act. The problem of terrorism urgently requires resolution, but it begs the question as to how we can respond effectively without igniting further acts of terror.",

The thought of families losing their loved ones is heartbreaking.

Women are being objectified and treated as nothing more than objects. It's difficult to see a solution to this issue, as the situation appears quite bleak.

It is truly heart-wrenching to witness the harm they endure due to the actions of others. The French authorities should feel ashamed for subjecting them to deplorable conditions. Nevertheless, we should also acknowledge the complex issue of immigration in this situation. While we cannot offer assistance to everyone, it is crucial to support initiatives that address the root causes of these issues within their native countries. This will prevent them from being forced to flee and endure more suffering elsewhere.",

It is disheartening to see that such incidents are not isolated, but rather a deep-rooted issue that pervades our society. Our inability to come together and find common ground is a primary factor in exacerbating the problem. Disagreement and discord only fuel the flames of this issue. To prevent such harm from occurring in the future, effective communication and cooperation are necessary. The lack of agreement and willingness to work together only lead to greater suffering and harm. It is vital that we address these issues and work towards a solution that benefits all.",

Instead, we need to focus on nurturing empathy and pushing for a tranquil solution to this emergency.",

It is truly disgusting to learn that young children are being subjected to opioid overdoses. It is difficult to grasp how these innocent toddlers are able to come into contact with such harmful substances. While it is possible that some parents may accidentally drop these pills, it is beyond comprehension that they would be so careless with their child's safety. This raises reasonable doubts about why these individuals would choose to become parents if they are not capable of providing a safe environment for their children. From my perspective, we need to take urgent action to implement laws that require potential parents to undergo a parenting assessment to ensure that only responsible and caring individuals can become parents.",

It's unsettling to imagine living in a place where the government and its law enforcement can act without accountability and inflict harm on individuals and groups. The idea of soldiers committing atrocities, including rape, and burning houses without reason is disturbing. The sad reality of aid workers and medical professionals being mistreated, and scarce resources hindering individuals' survival, truly breaks my heart. It's disheartening to acknowledge that despite existing in the year 2019, certain regions remain underdeveloped and uncivilized. Therefore, it's critical to bring these issues to the forefront because, at the end of the day, real human beings suffer, and every person deserves the assurance of safety in their homeland.",

I believe that they deserve to suffer, and the more they do, the better. However, I find it intriguing that despite being constrained by certain traditions, women in Saudi society hold a high status, similar to that of the elderly. They are revered and respected, despite the fact that their lives are beset with limitations. I find this paradoxical and confusing. I wonder if Saudi women fully understand the position they hold before they embark on their quest to change it.

As someone who worries often, I cannot help but think about how I would have taken extra precautions to ensure my child's safety in this situation.

Although, I believe a great deal of the worry is instigated by the liberal media's fearmongering tactics. It seems like this is a recurring trend with every president. I recall many people, particularly those of Caucasian descent, were apprehensive about President Obama's tenure, assuming he would only cater to African Americans. Similarly, some people these days surmise that Trump's policies are only beneficial to the upper-class Caucasians; however, this is an erroneous belief. People should remain open to the possibility that he is helping a diverse range of communities to unite rather than dividing us with hatred.

For instance, reading about the death toll of 4,000 civilians during crossfire is saddening. However, the impact is much greater when we read about one man who owned a taxi service or a single father with an ice cream truck who leaves behind eight children. These individual stories are devastating and emphasize the human tragedy behind the statistics.",

Currently detained in an immigration detention center, Adam is awaiting necessary arrangements that customs enforcement and immigration are making.

I believe that if more people knew the significance of expiration and use by dates, it would result in less waste. The way in which food is managed needs to improve and people need to understand the proper methods of handling it, rather than assuming everything will lead to the contraction of a foodborne illness. Additionally, implementing more compost piles instead of contributing to landfills is essential. It's encouraging to see an increase in advertisements regarding food waste, as it raises awareness. Unfortunately, many people remain oblivious to the impact of throwing food away, as they believe it's harmless to the environment.",

It's sad to see fighting and killing among comrades, which should only target harmful individuals, become a fruitless waste. I understand that Jordanian citizens were on high alert following previous suicide bombing incidents in Syria. I'm unsure if the soldiers involved somehow became enemies or if it was just a miscommunication. Either way, I have faith that the relevant authorities will conduct a thorough investigation to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring again.",

It's disappointing to witness leaders such as Putin still exert their authority over a modern society. In my view, distancing ourselves from Russia until they push towards peace is paramount. The inhumane actions committed by those in power and their efforts to suppress the truth are extremely concerning. Any individual in authority should not have the liberty to oppress or injure those who speak out against their governance. Putin epitomizes malevolent power, posing a risk to everyone. The extent of brutality and torture he inflicts on his people is beyond imagination. The mere thought of his reign expanding beyond Russia is genuinely terrifying. Thus, it is crucial to take all measures possible to contain his authority and push for his removal from power.",

To think that our water supply could be contaminated with dangerous amounts of lead that remain undetected is a truly terrifying thought. The fact that exceeding safe consumption levels does not have any consequences and that water testing is not done regularly is even more concerning. It is heartbreaking to know that crucial attention is only given when the situation turns into a severe crisis, as we have witnessed in past incidents such as Flint. Innocent children growing up in poorly monitored water communities is a harrowing reality that fills me with distress. To take precautions, I have had to switch to bottled water as tap water's safety cannot be trusted anymore.

Collaborative efforts towards finding a long-lasting and constructive resolution should take precedent over acts of hostility that endanger the lives and homes of innocent people. Taking inspiration from nonviolent strategies used by leaders like Trump, such as implementing economic sanctions, could be a step in the right direction. The recent termination of the ceasefire by both warring factions, especially considering their access to nuclear weapons, is a cause for alarm.

Among all the stories, the one that left me feeling the most distressed was about an elephant that ran amok through people's homes, leaving behind a trail of sadness and fear. The thought of a colossal being wreaking havoc on its surroundings and causing so much trauma is beyond my comprehension. Even though nobody suffered any physical injuries, I deeply empathize with the residents who had to endure such a horrific occurrence. The realization of the destruction caused by human activities weighs heavily on my mind, and my emotions are left scarred from this experience.",

It frightens me that in twenty nineteen, dictators with such a grip on power are still ruling over nations. Putin is a prime example of this, as I perceive him to be a malevolent individual. I believe that threats coerced many individuals into taking part in the cover-up. No one should be allowed to eliminate someone just because they dissent with the ruling authority. If Putin can perpetrate such unthinkable violence against his own people, I dread to think what he could do to the whole world. I am convinced that his excessive sway needs to be countered and he must be dethroned.",

The commitment of Germany to provide asylum to a million refugees weighs heavily on my mind, and I can't help but wonder how many of them have actually received the protection they need. It is unsettling to know that the arrival of a large number of refugees often triggers far-right nationalism and fascism worldwide.

The growing acceptance of police brutality in our society is alarming, and it is disheartening to see law enforcement officials seen as hostile instead of as allies who tirelessly work to ensure our safety and security. It's difficult to fathom the challenges they face on a daily basis, risking their lives to serve the public. Despite their crucial role in maintaining our safety, they are often exposed to great dangers, putting their own wellbeing at risk. As I grapple with this reality, a profound sense of sorrow envelops me, for which there are no adequate words to express.",

Discovering that the perpetrator bore the same name as the principal of my twins’ school was unsettling, imparting an unforeseen and alarming dimension to an already harrowing situation. I couldn't ignore the notion that this convergence may have been more than coincidental. The incident served as a poignant reminder that we can never be certain of someone's true capacity for harm. Presently, in the wake of the tragedy, I'm scrutinizing even those closest to me, including my spouse, who experiences work-related stress. Suffused with these feelings of vulnerability and unease, I find myself overwhelmed, unsure about what the future may hold.",

        "essay": "After perusing news articles on the continuing unrest in the Middle East, a profound sense of sorrow consumes me. It's distressing to witness nations that cherish harmony and positivity, like India, get swirled in such vehement conflict. I steadfastly advocate that the powers-that-be in the affected territories call for a diplomatic meeting to discover a sustainable resolution, rather than resorting to hostility and jeopardizing innocent lives and possessions. My suggestion is that our leaders follow Trump's nonviolent route by remaining steadfast and employing sanctions. The recent nullification of the ceasefire is alarming, notably due to the possession of nuclear weapons by both sides. The disregard for boundaries exhibited by these nations fills me with a sense of dread and anxiety.",

Although Germany had pledged to provide asylum to one million refugees, I cannot shake this unsettling feeling that many of them may not have received the necessary protection.

To me, Putin epitomizes malevolence, with his vast power posing a threat to everyone. The violence and torture that he subjects his citizens to are beyond comprehension.

The mere thought of being trapped in such a horrific mishap, with zero control and no means of escape, instills within me a deep-seated fear. I can only fathom the apprehension and chaos that engulfed those on board as the train spun out of control. The fact that a parallel tragedy had occurred in the past is unsettling, prompting me to question the root cause behind this recurring nightmare. It is of utmost importance that the authorities conduct an extensive inquiry to unveil the cause of the accident and steer clear of its reoccurrence. I resolutely support the suspension of train operations until the root cause is pinpointed and correctly resolved to ensure the safety of forthcoming passengers. Losing lives in such avoidable circumstances is intolerable, and we must put into effect adequate security measures to avoid future tragedies.",

The very thought of one human being committing such heinous acts against another is truly gut-wrenching. The life of the victim was grossly disregarded, and the complete disregard for his worth is absolutely chilling. To think that despite the sheer brutality of the crime, the perpetrators could very well walk free is disheartening. While the killers continue on with their daily lives, it's sickening that the victim was callously dumped into a shallow grave. The reasoning behind their senseless brutality is nothing short of outrageous- it was simply because the victim didn't reciprocate romantic feelings for one of the suspects. This atrocity is evidence of a deeply flawed mindset. I grieve for the innocent victim who was robbed of his life in such a merciless manner.",

The articles present conflicting and perplexing information, which makes it arduous to come to a well-informed decision. The mistreatment and suffering of innocent animals that contract this illness is distressing, and it leaves a deep feeling of sadness.

It's heart-wrenching to witness the immense suffering endured by the birds, but what's even more disheartening is our lack of action. The fact that our failure to act due to ignorance may persist worries me deeply. It's alarming to see that we persist in intervening without realizing the potential consequences, making the same mistakes we've made with coal and oil. This realization is unsettling. Moreover, the possible impact of wind turbine farms on the environment is a legitimate concern. Is there concrete research that shows that these structures can result in more violent storms and tornadoes? The very thought of humanity ignoring the dangers of our actions fills me with terror.

        "essay": "After reading the news about the train accident, a profound sense of overwhelming sadness swept over me. The very thought of being stuck in a catastrophic event and feeling helpless to escape fills me with intense anxiety. I can only imagine the horror experienced by those aboard the train and their families. The chaos and hopelessness that took hold of the passengers as the train derailed must have been unbearable. The recurrence of similar incidents in the past raises critical questions about the root causes of these tragedies, adding to the deep sadness within me. I firmly believe that the authorities must launch a meticulous investigation to identify the underlying problem and take immediate measures to prevent such disasters from recurring. For as long as the safety of the passengers cannot be guaranteed, I strongly advocate for the cease of train operations. Losing lives, particularly in preventable situations, is simply unacceptable. We must take prompt and effective action to avoid such heart-wrenching events from happening again. The original text's emotions of fear and sadness are retained.",

I feel helpless knowing that our lack of knowledge and effort in preventing harm may continue. It's alarming to see our persistence in intervening without comprehending the potential consequences as we repeat mistakes from our past with coal and oil. Replicating these missteps is an unsettling thought. The potential impact of wind turbine farms on the environment is also a concern.

The piece brings to light the dangers that accompany smoking in public places, particularly those that are visited by young, impressionable minds such as zoos and theme parks. It is crucial that we enact a public smoking ban, similar to laws surrounding alcohol consumption, to shield children from exposure to these harmful substances. Young individuals often develop misguided attitudes towards smoking that can have negative repercussions on their health and well-being. Shielding them from such harmful exposure and guiding them towards healthier lifestyle choices is pivotal. With the proposed smoking ban, we have the chance to create a healthy and smoke-free environment, one that will last for generations to come.

It pains me to see how the safety and wellbeing of immigrants have been compromised, especially in a country that was once known for welcoming them with open arms. Witnessing Germany's transformation into a place of turmoil and unrest is disheartening. My thoughts are with those who are currently seeking refuge and safety amidst this chaos. Despite the current situation, I hold onto hope that Germany will restore its former glory and return to being a safe haven for all.

        "essay": "After reviewing the recent events, I would first like to express my deepest sympathies to those who have been impacted by this unfortunate situation. It is clear that the local police and community members had good intentions in trying to protect wildlife and its inhabitants. However, I am also aware of the financial difficulties that some villagers are facing, which may have led to the sale of the animal's meat. While I understand that hardship and despair can often lead to defiance, it is concerning to hear about the physical harm and mistreatment directed towards the officers who were carrying out their duties. Nonetheless, I find hope in the fact that the officers survived and that, in this challenging time, the village and the authorities can collaborate to identify and implement a mutually beneficial solution. I am optimistic that the authorities will take measures to facilitate this process and support the affected communities in their efforts to move forward with positivity and hope.",

It brought to my attention how places like zoos and theme parks are filled with impressionable young minds that should be protected from the dangers of smoking. Similar to alcohol consumption laws, cigarette smoking should be prohibited in public spaces. The children who witness smokers in these areas develop a misguided perception that smoking is acceptable. By eliminating this exposure from the next generation, we can help them make better, healthier choices in the long run. This proposed ban offers a remarkable opportunity to diminish the number of new smokers and finally end smoking's social acceptance. I strongly support this initiative and fail to see any downside to its implementation.",

It is heartbreaking to see lives cut short due to tragic events that occurred while these individuals were simply fulfilling their responsibilities. It is disheartening to witness the continuation of hazardous working conditions despite full knowledge of their dangerous nature, leading to devastating consequences. While the closure of around 1000 operations is commendable, I believe that more action must be taken. To prevent further loss of human life, I propose the establishment of a regulatory body similar to OSHA in the US, to prioritize worker safety and prevent senseless deaths. Families of the victims are now struggling with both financial and emotional burdens, having lost their primary breadwinners. In conclusion, I truly hope that such events do not reoccur, and that workers are able to perform their duties with greater confidence in safe and secure conditions.",

Witnessing lives suddenly cut short whilst performing mundane tasks is a heart-wrenching sight. Further, it is shocking to observe hazardous working conditions persist despite knowledge of the risks, leading to devastating consequences. While the closure of roughly one thousand risky operations is a positive step, additional measures should be implemented to prevent future loss of lives. Proposing the establishment of a regulatory body comparable to OSHA in the US, prioritizing worker safety to avoid similar tragic incidents, is a plausible solution. The victim's families are now burdened with both financial and emotional stress following the loss of the primary source of income. My sincere hope is that such heart-breaking events never occur again, and workers can carry out their responsibilities, trusting that they are in a safe and secure environment.",

It's unsettling to learn that her parents are out of jail and may pose a severe threat to society. The fact that they could commit heinous acts against their child highlights their level of depravity, making it difficult to trust them again. One can only hope that they will never harm another child. It's devastating to think that the girl will never retrieve her lost childhood as her parents, the supposed protectors, were the ones responsible for her suffering. The trauma she endured will undoubtedly cause turmoil, but it is my sincere hope that she receives the necessary support and assistance to heal and overcome her ordeal with hope and resilience.",

The story chronicled the incredible life of a woman who achieved an outstanding feat - becoming the first editor-in-chief of Elle magazine at age 30, despite battling depression for several years. Although she underwent psychiatric treatment and was eventually discharged, it's devastating to learn that she succumbed to her struggles and drowned in the ocean. It's disheartening that she didn't get the help she needed. Reflecting on this tragic incident, it reminds me of the importance of reassuring our loved ones that we'll always be there for them, providing constant support, and helping them overcome any challenges that come their way.",

Despite there being various movements, awareness and activism for women's rights in America, we are still lagging behind in all gender equality categories. The current societal pressures puts women in a tough position, where many are shamed for prioritizing their career over starting a family. The harsh reality is that it is still a man's world, where the pay gap between men and women is staggering, making it difficult to find the motivation to strive for higher positions. However, focusing on girls and STEM education is imperative for empowering the next generation of women in math, science, and technology. This is where women often lack confidence, and with more emphasis on these areas, it will undoubtedly increase their chances of succeeding in the future. Despite the struggles, the hope for a brighter future, where gender equality becomes a reality, is what keeps me optimistic.",

As a species, Polar bears are severely impacted by the seasonal and year-to-year changes in Arctic sea ice. Notably, they heavily depend on the ice surface for crucial activities like hunting, traveling, and breeding. I was thrilled to learn about the recommendation made by the researchers for the National Climate Assessment to incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as an essential measure of climate change in its future reports. Currently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group utilizes the study's outcomes to assess polar bears and decide on their conservation status. Overall, this information brings me great joy.",

The cruelty of the attack and the dreadful outcome - a man losing his partner along with eight children - has shaken me to my core. Although I am grateful for the safety and independence provided by the United States, the government's decision to authorize such an attack deeply saddens me. It perpetuates the never-ending cycle of violence that brings harm to innocent individuals. All of this has left me crestfallen and without any hope, as this tragic incident has snatched away any joy from within me.",

The brutality of the attack, resulting in the loss of a man's partner and eight children, deeply impacted me. While I am grateful for the protection and independence provided by the United States, the government's decision to approve such a devastating attack is disheartening. It does nothing but perpetuate the cycle of violence that targets innocent people. Consequently, I find myself feeling crestfallen and without hope. This heart-wrenching incident has drained me of any remaining sliver of joy.",

Despite the appalling effects of war, I am taken aback by the sheer willpower of millions of people who strive to carry on with their lives.

It is difficult to fathom how these individuals cope with such cruel conditions and remain deprived of adequate nourishment. Their plight is heartbreaking, and the sheer agony they face every day fills me with immense sorrow. One can only hope that the war will come to an end, and these individuals will finally be able to experience a sense of normalcy in their lives.",

        "essay": "Upon reading about the ongoing crisis in Syria, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of sadness. The brutalities of war are beyond unimaginable, but what truly astonishes me is the unwavering strength of those who are forced to endure them. Amid countless gut-wrenching stories, the astronomical prices of basic necessities, such as a mere pound of meat costing around $40, struck a chord with me. It's disheartening to think about how these individuals are managing to survive under such dire circumstances, where even the most essential forms of sustenance are scarce. Witnessing their perpetual struggles fills me with immense sorrow; however, I hold onto hope that the war may come to an end soon, granting these vulnerable people the relief they so desperately require. Hopefully, they can start to rebuild their shattered lives.",

The United States, known for its well-stocked pantry, is devastatingly careless with its food resources at the cost of irreparable harm to the environment. To my surprise, the offering of monetary incentives has proven to be ineffective in remedying this problem. We must assume responsibility and adopt feasible solutions to combat this issue urgently.",

The unexpected revelation that squirrels could also serve as carriers of the sickness caught me off guard. It's remarkable how little we know about the preventive measures required to safeguard ourselves against contracting the disease. Initially, I believed that leprosy was an ailment that belonged in the past, and was only associated with historical times. However, after understanding that it still lingers today, my awareness has increased, and I now grasp the importance of being more cautious and attentive moving forward.",

It's impossible to fathom the atrocities of war, and the enduring strength of those who face it. Among the countless heartbreaking stories, the high prices of basic necessities such as a pound of meat costing around $40 shook me to the core. It's devastating to think about how these individuals are managing to survive under such dire circumstances where even the most basic forms of sustenance are scarce. Witnessing their ongoing struggles fills me with immense sorrow. However, I hold onto hope that the war may cease soon, providing these vulnerable people with some much-needed relief.

The statistics presented were startling, indicating that more than half a million people in India perish annually due to this issue.

The report emphasized the significant toll the water shortage was having on the survival of the community residing in the area. Learning about the lack of prioritization of water access in some parts of the United States was particularly disheartening. The severity of the drought had far-reaching consequences, with one species nearing the brink of extinction.

However, the sudden increase in youth suicides left me with a sense of distress and unease. The link between the rise in suicide rates among young people and the introduction of iPhones piqued my interest, but I recognize that other factors could also contribute. The potential hazards of social media and the internet for younger people cannot be downplayed. When the woman said that children never contemplate taking their own lives, it made me smile. This idea resonates deeply with me, and I was surprised and gratified to find that others shared my experience, particularly because I have personally grappled with suicidal thoughts in the past.",

The article exposed how the nation's dependence on coal has led to significant suffering for underprivileged communities, a fact that was truly heartbreaking. The story of the elephant family caught up in this tragedy was particularly poignant and left me feeling disheartened and amazed. It is hard to overstate the gravity of this urgent problem, and I am struggling to express the intense emotions that this news story stirred within me.",

I was completely taken aback by the brutal attack on the anti-poaching rangers carried out by a group of assailants. It left me wondering if their dedication to putting an end to poaching was the reason behind the attack or if it had to do with financial issues. Unfortunately, it's disheartening that those who strive to bring improvement in their communities or societies often become targets of premeditated acts of violence. This incident highlights the harsh and unsettling realities of our world, which can be merciless and brutal. As a result, I find myself contemplating the motives that drive such savage attacks.",

She was only thirty when the magazine started which is crazy to me. Imagine being thirty and running a whole magazine. She suffered from depression all of her life and even wrote a book about it. She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.",

I think of how many families no longer have their children any longer. Then the situation in the Middle East is heartbreaking as well. Young kids, some teenagers have been used as pawns in this sick game. Women are being treated like pieces of meat.I wish I could say that there was something that we as a nation can do, but the situation looks pretty bleak. I think maybe the best thing to do is to stop invading these countries for their oil. It's our own fault in many ways.",

Later the same day, when her mother turns up at the school, there is no sign of her daughter. No-one has seen her. This is really sad and terrifying.",

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.",

Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do. Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to. I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess. I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad. But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?",

This whole movement was also based on a complete lie. The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit. That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

I don't see a simple fix here. It's easy to sit there and judge and say this is unfair, but also what is everyone supposed to do? AT least they are being given asylum from the dangerous place they came from I guess.",

They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas.

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations. Lina was left in that car for 38 hours. Can you believe this? This deeply disturbs me. How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours? Just unbelievable. The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand. I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals. It's infuriating. No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day. (",

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant.",

They are being persecuted in Burma and forced out of neighboring Bangladesh. I feel like Suu Kyi is being unfairly blamed for a situation that is just too complex for the country to solve effectively. I'm really trying to put myself into the shoes of one of the oppressed Muslim minorities like the Rohingya or the Uyghers and having a very difficult time imagining what a day in their lives must be like.",

They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up.

I think that way more safety and procedures being done for these people then just collecting fuel from a truck on the side of the rode. Anything can happen with such a flammable liquid and people that dont really know alot getting it out. I feel horrible for the people who responded to the scene as that had to have been so scarring to see. So many families will be at a loss from this and i think the government should do alot to help out with there life now.",

It just sounds completely horrific and with such a terrible ending too. It would have been much different if they had been able to rescue him but clearly that was not possible.

With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it. The future deinitly gives me hope for my gender to succeed.",

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons. But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion. Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause. The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump. Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back. Welcome to it.",

I know that people are quick to jump to parental neglect, but sometimes the only way to keep your apartment cool is to keep the windows open. The recent heat waves across the planet have not helped with this at all. You can't help but feel sorry for the poor family.",

I understand if you don't have air conditioning it might need to be wide, but why can't we have limits so that a small body can't fall out? It's a terrible thing, and one I'm sure the parents never even considered. Alternative to that I suppose you'd have to not have anything at all a child could climb up to the window on. It's just too sad though, because you would need to not even have a stool - at two, a kid could certainly move one of those.",

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much. And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds. These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way. However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions. It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it? How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something. I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms. Do we understand that? Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms? I'm sure no one understands that either.",

I think it's ironic that the U.S. gets this reputation as a racist country and all that stuff, but the French response was just the same as ours. The government took extra power to increase safety. People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off. The nation grieved. Sounds a lot like America after 9/11. We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond). The French aren't quite as bold. The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing. how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show. Awful to live with.",

This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered. However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs. I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs. People are killed by dogs. Dogs are weapons, too. No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog? Yes.

Elephants are highly intelligent and social creatures, and I couldn't help but draw a parallel between the people that are imprisoned in this country. They are also held in cages and forced into indentured servitude. Our whole society is forged and maintained by ostracizing and taking advantage of out groups, humans, animals everything that lives and breathes.",

However, the idea that you'd do this so that children don't even see adults smoking seems absurd to me. I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public. Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants? Or is that \"normal\" and \"okay,\" while smoking isn't for some reason. This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism. These people have gone too far in trying to control things and bully legal things out of existence. It angers me.",

I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.",

I can understand that protests can become unsafe or even violent so you need tactics to over come that but with such numbers of people getting very hurt and permanently disabled I think thye should change there tactics.

The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats. Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats? For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN? Screw that.",

I feel like theres so many different levels to these happenings and something has to be done on each to prevent little children from getting these pills in there hands. On the level of the manufactorers we need to have way better packaging like codes the kids cant get into. Doctors prescribing these should ask if they have kids and tell them preventetive measures that should be taken to reduce the risk of exposure. Parents need to have a better understanding how easy it is for kids to get into these and die. So senseless dying of something so easy to prevent.",

Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood. Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it. And believe me, I understand \"sport.\" But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there.

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating. They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen. I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays. Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves. I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it. But I still don't understand it. Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.",

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.",

There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns.

I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting. Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully. Not that they outright lie.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness. Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon.",

People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world.
