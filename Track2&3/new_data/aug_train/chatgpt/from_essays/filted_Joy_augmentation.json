Although I don't have a specific attachment to dogs, the article's portrayal of their suffering left me with an immense sadness.

The details regarding dog meat consumption in some regions of the world only amplified my sorrow. I empathize with those who have lost their beloved furry friends or cherished relatives. Imagining the immense agony they must be going through, my heart goes out to them, and I offer my sincerest sympathies.",

        "essay": "The mere sight of polar bears always brings me an immense sense of joy as they are the epitome of climate change. The survival and well-being of these magnificent creatures are largely dependent on the Arctic sea ice's seasonal and year-to-year variations, which climate change heavily impacts. It brings a sense of warmth to my heart to learn that the National Climate Assessment researchers have suggested the inclusion of measuring spring and fall ice advance and retreat timings in future reports. It fills me with excitement to know that the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group is utilizing this information to evaluate and determine the best conservation efforts for these animals. I am determined to do my part in supporting their conservation and safeguarding their continued existence.",
