Such individuals are nothing more than violent savages who deserve no quarter or mercy. It's disgraceful that we withdrew from the region in a cowardly manner. Furthermore, it's hard to ignore the fact that the people of this region are partially to blame for their predicament. They're complicit in allowing this toxic ideology to fester, and they're now paying the price. Although one might argue that it's a result of U.S. interference, the truth is that it's been around for centuries. Other nations have fought against their foes, both internal and external, without being passive. Yet, the Arabs and Persians seem to be content with being impotent under their overlords."}
