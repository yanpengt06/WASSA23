It's disheartening to see that the economy is given more importance than anything else, especially when the population is so high.

It's frustrating that the U.S. and other civilized countries try to do everything in their power to save the environment but it seems to be a futile effort. It's appalling that we are considered barbarians in the world even though most of the world is one step above apes, consisting of heathens.

Confronting gender discrimination firsthand in my career, I discovered that despite having an equivalent position with my male counterpart, he raked in a baffling 40% more than I did. Unfortunately, the threat of losing my job precludes me from speaking out against this injustice, owing to the prevalence of at-will employment laws in most states. This reality of societal inequity and injustice is painfully infuriating, sickening and heartbreaking.", "empathy": 1.714285714, "distress": 5.428571429, "emotion": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "source_essay": "Despite living in modern times, it's disconcerting to realize that little has been done to achieve gender equality. The fact that the United States ranks 45th, trailing behind African countries, is alarming. Throughout the past century, it appears that politics and the government have prioritized their own agenda over ensuring equal treatment and opportunities for all genders. Personally, I have encountered discrimination in my career. Despite having an equivalent position to my male colleague, he earned 40% more than me. Sadly, the fear of losing my job prevents me from speaking out as most states have at-will employment laws. The injustice and inequality prevalent today elicit feelings of anger, disgust, and sadness."}
