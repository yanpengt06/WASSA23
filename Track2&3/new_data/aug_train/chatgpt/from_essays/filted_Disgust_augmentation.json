The conflicts and destruction that often follow these clashes are truly heart-wrenching, and it's disheartening to think that many of them could have been prevented. It seems that as a society, we're more interested in building things up only to tear them down again. It's particularly upsetting when larger nations mistreat and marginalize smaller ones, expecting them to accept their fate quietly. In these trying times, it's more important than ever for us to cultivate compassion and solidarity to confront and overcome these challenges.

This calls into question their ability to provide a secure environment for their children, leaving me with feelings of disgust.

        "essay": "Upon reading news articles that depict harm inflicted upon individuals or groups, I am overcome with a sense of disgust. The agony and distress that the victims endure is truly alarming and gut-wrenching. However, I also contemplate if there are any contributory factors that lead to the atrocities. It seems as though the victims succumb to their pitiful fate without putting up a challenge, akin to passive citizens who lack the willpower to resist those in power. This leaves me pondering when they will take matters into their own hands and stand up for their rights. Why do they continue to be subjugated by their circumstances, instead of striving for a better future? It's noteworthy that other nations have fought against oppressive regimes and progressed as a society, so why haven't these individuals formed a stable culture, even after thousands of years?",

It's truly disheartening to learn that such events are not just isolated instances, but rather a deeply ingrained problem that permeates our society. Our inability to unite and find common ground only serves to exacerbate the issue. Disagreements and discord only add fuel to the fire. To prevent further harm, it is necessary to have effective communication and cooperation. Without an agreement and willingness to work together, we can only expect to see even greater suffering and harm. It's essential that we confront these issues head-on and work towards a solution that benefits everyone involved.",

One can only pray that they recuperate swiftly and do not suffer any lingering psychological trauma. It's extremely concerning that there exist individuals amongst us, who could indulge in such abhorrent acts. The mere contemplation of these cruel and monstrous deeds is truly distressing and brings deep sadness to our hearts.",

It's unsettling to imagine living in a place where the government and its law enforcement can act without accountability and inflict harm on individuals and groups. The idea of soldiers committing atrocities, including rape, and burning houses without reason is disturbing. The sad reality of aid workers and medical professionals being mistreated, and scarce resources hindering individuals' survival, truly breaks my heart. It's disheartening to acknowledge that despite existing in the year 2019, certain regions remain underdeveloped and uncivilized. Therefore, it's critical to bring these issues to the forefront because, at the end of the day, real human beings suffer, and every person deserves the assurance of safety in their homeland.",

Witnessing how humans often behave carelessly towards animals and the environment is disheartening, as we forget that animals have their own emotions and families, which necessitates treating them with respect and fairness. It's saddening to observe how, by disrupting their habitats, participating in unethical wildlife trade, and mistreating them, we are steadily pushing these creatures towards extinction. It's ironic that while mother nature does care for these animals, our actions towards them are anything but intelligent or kind. Despite being the most intelligent species on the planet, our treatment of our fellow creatures and the environment is anything but intelligent or humane.",

However, my worry is about the global impact of their influx on our countries, which is alarming, both on an individual and national level. Allowing these individuals to infiltrate our societies can have severe consequences. The strong and innocent are at risk from the weak and corrupt, as we have seen with the citizens of Germany bearing the consequences. The idea of being a resident in Germany, and hearing Merkel's proclamation to welcome a million refugees is both disgusting and imprudent. It's madness to surrender our nations to such terrible regions. We cannot even consider residing there.",

The discovery of the woman, wandering coatless in the middle of the night, is terrifying and highlights society's indifference towards assisting those in need. She appeared disoriented and under the influence of drugs, and it is my sincere hope that she receives the support and help required. The incident has left me feeling disgusted with the lack of empathy displayed by people towards a vulnerable person in distress.",

However, my concern is the global state, and the impact of their invasion on our countries is alarming, both from an individual and national perspective. The consequences of allowing these people to infiltrate our societies worries me. The good are threatened by the weak and corrupt, something that is occurring frequently, such as in Germany, where the citizens pay the price. The thought of being a German resident and hearing Merkel proclaim that they shall welcome one million refugees is disgusting, how can they tolerate it? It's imprudent to surrender our nations to these dreadful regions, let's not even consider residing there. It's sheer madness.",

To add further to the dismay, the US is lagging far behind Scandinavian countries in STEM skills professions, which is deeply concerning. Despite all the rhetoric and talk of progress, the disparity in salaries between men and women has remained stagnant since 2008, and this contributes to the overall frustration and disgust about the current state of women's rights.",

One such obstacle - the requirement for women to obtain permission from a male guardian before traveling abroad - is incredibly repugnant. This demand directly conflicts with basic human rights, as it assumes women are unable to make decisions for themselves. Women are capable of independence and deserve complete control over their travel plans. The practice seems archaic and should be eliminated without delay.

Discovering that he is now being deported due to the incompetence of his foster family and the adoption agency only adds to my outrage. It is inconceivable how those responsible for such gross injustices can bear to live with themselves, fully aware of the immense harm they have inflicted upon someone who has already suffered greatly.",

It's truly heartbreaking to read about the horrors that occurred and it evokes a deep sense of sorrow for the current state of our world. Prior to this incident, I held the belief that individuals held a mixture of good and bad, but this atrocity has caused me to re-think my viewpoint. It's revolting and unacceptable that someone or a group could commit such a heinous act. The problem of terrorism urgently requires resolution, but it begs the question as to how we can respond effectively without igniting further acts of terror.",

Pointing fingers at drug companies or others is nonsensical because drug users bear the sole responsibility. Moreover, it's inexcusable to grant access to medication to a baby; it should be securely stored in high cabinets, out of reach of children. It's enraging that drug use is frequently unnecessary and people yield to addiction or weakness. This is an utterly disgraceful state of affairs that cannot be overlooked!",

Witnessing the overflowing shopping carts at the grocery store, it's clear why so much food gets thrown away.

It's disheartening to think about how much could be done to reduce this waste, yet so few are taking action.",

The terror and suffering that they must face is truly dreadful. However, another part of me cannot help but think that perhaps they have brought this upon themselves. It seems that these individuals are akin to sheep, passive citizens who meekly accept their dismal fate that has been thrust upon them by those in power. It is those with zeal and drive who influence and bend these meek souls to their will. The question that arises is when will these people choose to fight back? Rather than remaining victims to their circumstances, when will they act towards something better? Other nations have done so. In fact, many countries have had to fight civil wars to attain some level of progress and civilization. It raises the question, why have these people failed to steer themselves towards forming a stable culture, even after thousands of years?",

The brutality exhibited in the killings is truly disturbing, and my heart aches for the families of the victims. The coalition responsible for the attack has shown a complete disregard for human life, particularly given the hospital's humanitarian mission. I am appalled that the US would provide assistance given the faulty information and the shockingly high number of civilian casualties. The aftermath of this ordeal has left numerous injured individuals stranded, forced to travel great distances for medical aid after the hospital's closure. This situation is deeply unsettling and troubling.",

It is as if we have been transported back in time, with the group destroying natural resources and using innocent people as human shields in order to maintain their hold on power. Despite knowing deep down that their fight is futile, they continue to devastate cities and annihilate innocent lives instead of surrendering. The sheer disregard for human life and dignity is sickening.",

One thing that strikes me as intriguing is the elevated position that women, despite being bound to certain traditions, hold in their society. It is akin to the status of the elderly. Although they have numerous limitations placed upon their lives, as a result they are treated with reverence and respect. For instance, while my brother could engage in a confrontation with a Saudi man, he is forbidden from doing so with a woman.

The issue of terrorism calls for immediate attention, but how can we effectively address it without fueling more acts of terror?",

It is immensely disturbing that those in power have the ability to put an end to this but have chosen to look the other way. They have a responsibility to be a voice for this suffering animal and take action to improve its situation. Surely, this animal deserves much better than the inhumane treatment it is currently receiving.

The nauseating feeling this creates is unbearable. How could anyone be capable of inflicting this kind of heinous and dehumanizing torture upon their child? Thankfully both perpetrators were caught and each received a sentence of 20 years. It is disheartening to know that their time has been served.

I am particularly disheartened by the recent news that parents knowingly sent their children to a tailor who was involved in this heinous practice. It is incredibly distressing to think that these young girls were robbed of their innocence, and that those responsible for their well-being failed to keep them safe. My heart aches for these victims and their families.",
