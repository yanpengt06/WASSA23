        "essay": "After reading about the vicious murder of Muslims in Burma, one cannot help but be filled with a powerful sense of anger. Though it's important to safeguard the nation against terrorist activities, forcibly expelling an entire Muslim community is both extreme and unjust. Rather than sacrificing the basic human rights of individuals or promoting discrimination against any specific community, we must emphasize the value of peaceful and justifiable measures and treat each person with dignity. While providing aid and assistance to Burma is crucial, it must not come at the cost of mistreating innocent individuals. It's crucial that we identify solutions that prioritize the welfare and esteem of all those involved.",

Our selfish and negligent actions have caused other nations to view us as bullies, who demand compliance or suffer the consequences. We must recognize the negative impact of our mistakes and take immediate action to make things right. It is essential that we introduce transformative measures to mend the damage that has been done.",

The notion that a parent could exhibit such unambiguous apathy towards their own child is nothing short of outrageous. The news has triggered a profound sense of shame within me. The explanation that the mother provided about the incident seems implausible as the child had been sleeping for an entire hour prior to the event. It is impossible to rationalize the catastrophic outcome of this mother's actions. The extent of this terrible behavior is unsettling, and it has left me completely bewildered.",

It's crucial to acknowledge that a few individuals who identify as Muslims have perpetrated these violent acts, but we cannot hold the entire Islamic community accountable for their actions. Instead of implementing a sweeping ban on immigration from certain countries, we must take steps to protect ourselves and address the root causes of terrorism. We need to focus on creating a safer global community that benefits everyone. Only then can we truly combat terrorism and prevent further tragedies from occurring.",

Though these issues loom large and seem distant, I still cannot help but feel detached from them. I recognize the importance of maintaining autonomy and keeping citizens safe is every nation's obligation, and these concerns should certainly be prioritized. And yet, I am incensed with the UN's interventionism in these matters. Their involvement comes across as self-serving and without purpose. The UN's habit of scrutinizing and criticizing government actions as either too harsh or not stringent enough regarding perceived threats strikes me as short-sighted. I am bewildered as to how the UN can justify ignoring a government's responsibility to shield their citizens from legitimate dangers while focusing exclusively on moral justifications to shelter migrants. The UN's inaction in addressing these issues seems insincere and pompous, only serving to compound my ire towards them.",

In my view, war is a chaotic and unforgiving endeavor, where polite gestures have no place, and harsh tactics must be utilized to achieve victory. In the context of World War II, playing fair was not sufficient—we had to resort to nuclear warfare to bring Germany to its knees. The fact of the matter is that civilians unavoidably become entwined in the web of war and their safety cannot be ignored. In Yemen, the decision to allow rebel groups that receive support from Iran to gain power has resulted in innocent citizens being exposed to dangers and threats against Saudi Arabia. The notion that Saudi Arabia should prioritize the safety of Yemeni citizens over their own people is nonsensical. The kingdom must fight with all its might, regardless of the consequences. Victory is imperative, and sparing individuals' feelings is not a consideration to be taken seriously. Anyone who perceives it differently is misguided and may even be perilous. My anger towards those who fail to recognize the ugly realities of war is profound.",

The UN's condemnation and scrutiny of a government's actions for either being too strict or not doing enough regarding perceived threats disregards the bigger picture. I find it confusing how the UN can disregard a government's right to protect its people from real and existential threats while focusing solely on superficial moral reasons to offer shelter to migrants.

Unfortunately, the threat of losing my job precludes me from speaking out against this injustice, owing to the prevalence of at-will employment laws in most states.

The shocking statistics that nearly a third of all elephants have been killed solely for their ivory leaves me feeling an overwhelming mix of anger and surprise. It's disheartening to learn that this barbaric practice still persists, and it's imperative that immediate and more proactive steps are taken to curb it. If we fail to act now, these awe-inspiring animals will be lost forever due to human greed. The practice of slaughtering elephants for ivory serves no purpose except for selfish material gain and should be put to an end immediately.",

The lack of action prompts me to question the effectiveness of the authorities in charge. Negligence of this level would not be acceptable in any other industry, which makes the government's inaction absurd.

The article blames Trump for any wrongdoing against Israel, yet this accusation is unfounded. In actuality, Trump has been a strong supporter of Israel, unlike his predecessor Obama, who not only failed to aid Israel but even formed an alliance with its sworn enemy, Iran. It is unjust to hold Trump responsible for any increase in anti-Semitic sentiment. Instead, he is merely a reflection of the necessary cultural changes that have been long overdue. The 2016 pushback from white men can be attributed to the constant bombardment of the LGBTQ+ community, minorities, and women. Our issues surpass Trump's presidency, and we must tackle them accordingly. Thus, I welcome you to the resistance.",

However, my emotional response quickly changes when I ponder the underlying causes of this situation. The country possesses vast wealth from its oil reserves but has been stripped of its resources due to the corrupt practices of communism. My anger and disgust are directed towards the centralized government that perpetuates an environment that only benefits a select group of treacherous officials. The inherent flaws within such a governing system rapidly give way to corruption and abuse, as is evident in the current catastrophic situation in Venezuela. A decentralized system is more transparent as it ensures accountability for those in power, making it easier to prevent them from committing misdeeds. I deeply regret that this crisis in Venezuela is not limited to its borders, but has become a global concern of our own.",

        "essay": "Upon reading news articles about ethnic and religious conflicts, civilian displacement, violent extremist actions, and government crackdowns, my heart is filled with anger and frustration. These issues are overwhelming and yet, I still feel detached from them. I understand that protecting citizens and maintaining autonomy falls within a nation's obligation, and these concerns should be addressed internally. However, I cannot help but be infuriated by the UN's interventionism in such matters. Their involvement seems self-serving and pointless. The UN's tendency to criticize and scrutinize a government's actions for being too strict or not doing enough regarding perceived threats disregards the bigger picture. I am perplexed how the UN can ignore a government's right to protect their people from real and existential threats, while focusing solely on superficial moral reasons to provide shelter to migrants. The UN's inactivity in addressing these issues appears pretentious and self-righteous, and it is exacerbating my anger towards them.",

However, one of the members appeared indifferent to the matter at hand and dismissed the impact of herring, abalone and diesel oil. Nonetheless, this same individual found it ludicrous that the premier of B.C, from the NDP party, would condemn the cleanup crew. They recognized the difficult working conditions faced by the crew and deemed blaming them as unwarranted. The participant felt that accidents are bound to happen when dealing with vast amounts of diesel in a distant site. Additionally, the individual predicted that indigenous people would express their fury as they believe they own the province. Although regrettable, the participant suggested the best course of action would be to clean up the mess and prevent future accidents.

War, in my opinion, is a chaotic and unpleasant affair with no room for politeness - harsh tactics must be employed to triumph. In World War II, playing fair was not enough - we had to resort to nuclear warfare to level Germany. Civilians are an unavoidable part of war and must be taken into account. In Yemen, innocent citizens have been put in harm's way due to the decision to let rebel groups supported by Iran gain power, leading to threats against Saudi Arabia. To suggest that Saudi Arabia prioritize the safety of Yemeni citizens over their own people is absurd. They must fight with every ounce of strength they can muster, consequences be damned. Winning the war is crucial, and sparing individuals' feelings should not even be a consideration. Any thoughts to the contrary are misguided and could prove to be dangerous.

The potential for abuse and corruption grows exponentially under such a system, as evidenced by the current catastrophe unfolding in Venezuela. Who will protect the protectors? It's far easier to hold those in power accountable when they are operating under a decentralized system. Regrettably, Venezuela's woes cannot be relegated solely to their borders - this crisis has now become our own.",

The article places blame solely on Trump for any alleged wrongdoing against Israel, without any substantial evidence to back up this claim. In contrast, Trump has been unwavering in his support of Israel, a stance that differs greatly from his predecessor Obama who formed an alliance with Iran, Israel’s sworn enemy. Holding Trump responsible for any increase in anti-Semitic sentiment is not only unfounded but unjust. Trump is merely a reflection of the much-needed cultural changes that have been long overdue. It's evident that the pushback from white men in 2016 was a response to constant attacks on LGBTQ+ community, minorities and women. Therefore, we must address the underlying issues that extend beyond Trump's presidency. I welcome everyone to join the resistance in creating a better future for all.",

The consequences of this greed are dire, not only for humans but also for the elephant habitats that are being irreversibly damaged. It is heart-wrenching to know that there have already been 75 human lives and 30 innocent elephants lost. The impact on the people's health, particularly the younger generation, is distressing. The government's neglect of providing clean air and water is unacceptable. Those in power must take action urgently to stop this ongoing tragedy.

In my view, these individuals are hardly civilized and it doesn't matter whether the Houthis or civilians become casualties. Those who behave immorally deserve what they get. I understand that the Houthis have constitutional support from Iran, but I'm clearly in favor of the coalition because this is essentially a battle between Iran and those who are relatively better than them (which, let's be real, isn't saying much). However, I believe that if one is to go to war, they should be prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve victory. This includes the killing of civilians. If your intention isn't to win, why even bother? And in the case of Yemen, rather than merely meddling, we should annihilate the entire country and allow the rightful government to restore order.",

It's hard to believe that those who travel to the Arctic to witness the beauty of polar bears, don't consider the impact of their presence on their dwindling numbers. Perhaps they are even contributing to hunting them, which is deeply disturbing. It's clear that people can be selfish and hypocritical, expressing concern for causes without making any effort to change their actions. If we end up with extinct polar bears, then it's basically what we deserve. We can only hope that this serves as a wake-up call that inspires us to be more thoughtful stewards of our planet and its precious animals.",

It's truly heartbreaking to learn about the loss of experienced Captain and First Sergeant who held high-ranking positions. However, I confess that I struggle to feel the same level of sympathy for civilian casualties. I firmly believe that in times of war, hard fighting is necessary and collateral damage should be expected. Past wars have shown that victory often requires brutal measures, such as leveling entire cities or dropping nuclear bombs. While it may seem cruel, targeting civilians is sometimes a necessary evil to bring an end to the conflict. Simply focusing on insurgents or guerillas will not lead to victory, only prolonging the suffering and increasing the loss of life.",

It's unacceptable to cause harm to others for one's own pleasure. I am grateful that someone had the bravery to speak up and stop this individual from inflicting further damage upon women. While it's true that it can be difficult to discern the truth in certain situations, the multitude of women who have come forward makes it difficult to deny that this individual is a threat to society.

Despite that, I can't stifle my anger towards the UN, whose self-serving intrusion in matters that don't concern them is infuriating. The UN's judgments and critiques of governments for either not doing enough or being too strict on perceived threats ignores the greater picture, and it is utterly confusing how they can overlook a government's right to protect its citizens from genuine and existential threats while focusing on superficial moral reasons to provide refuge for migrants. In reality, the UN's inaction is nothing more than showiness and self-righteousness.",

It is revolting to know that our success has come at the expense of defenceless creatures. Despite living in fear like us, their lives are deemed as insignificant because it doesn't generate profits. It's difficult to turn a blind eye to this unyielding truth, and it should be even more challenging. What kind of world are we living in where our avarice triumphs over the wellbeing of all creatures? This reality is maddening.",

The handler left Lina in a hot car for 38 hours, despite her admirable service in drug investigations over the past three years. The handler is being investigated, and rightfully so. It's unbelievable that someone could be so negligent towards an animal that serves and protects. This lack of concern for both animal and human safety is appalling and unacceptable. It's disheartening to know that this isn't the only case of such recklessness, as we have lost 82 innocent lives this year alone, including children. This realization fills me with anger and deeply disturbs me. I cannot accept any excuses for this level of carelessness.",

Without access to vaccinations, we face the return of dangerous diseases like smallpox, measles, and of course, cholera.

I find it distressing that young people can be so easily influenced and consumed by the online world that they lose their sense of self. It is absolutely essential for parents to take responsibility and ensure that their children live in the real world, as well as provide them with the tools they need to be accountable and resilient. Regrettably, this can be a daunting task in Russia due to the prevalent issues faced by many parents who struggle with alcoholism. Tragically, this often results in youth suicides. It is unfathomable to me that someone could become so weak and vulnerable that they feel compelled to take their own life because of something they saw online. Although I don't consider myself to be exceptionally strong, this concept remains entirely foreign to me.",

However, one particular participant seems indifferent to the news, stating that they don't care about herring, abalone, or the diesel oil's impact. Despite this, the participant finds it absurd that the premier of B.C., from the NDP party, would criticize the cleanup crew. They acknowledge the challenging conditions that the crew worked in and believe that blaming them is undeserved. The participant understands that accidents like this can happen when large amounts of diesel are on board, and the site is far away. They also predict that indigenous people will express outrage as they believe they own the province. Although unfortunate, the participant thinks that the best course of action is to clean it up and try to prevent it from happening again. In any case, their lack of concern remains unchanged.",

It is impossible to fathom why anyone would want to take the lives of innocent individuals, particularly their own family. If the man in question was struggling with the weight of losing his wife, he should have sought out professional help to deal with his emotions. The fact that he chose this horrific path is simply unforgivable. His children, who were entirely innocent, were robbed of the opportunity to live their lives. To say that this act was ungodly would be an understatement, and it takes immense courage to deal with the anger and sadness that comes with it. The perpetrator deserves nothing but contempt, and my heart goes out to the wife and kids who have suffered so much.",

Unfortunately, in Russia, this can be a challenge as there is a prevalent issue with parents not being capable caregivers due to alcoholism, which tragically often leads to youth suicides.

It's difficult to fathom why the government would deny access to vaccines, even with potential side effects since it's still better than certain death. Distributing chlorine tablets for water is an excellent precautionary measure to curb epidemics along with vaccines. I empathize with the medical professionals, who are already overworked and cannot help these suffering individuals.",

It left me distressed, especially the situation in Haiti where a significant number of people were affected by the disease. It's frustrating to witness how corruption has led to the refusal of vaccines offered by the World Health Organization to help the government manage the situation. It's saddening to think that there were viable solutions available to tackle the problem, yet they were not implemented, resulting in the loss of several lives. The news stirred up strong feelings of frustration within me.",

In their opinion, anyone who gets punched in the face by a cop deserves no sympathy, as they must have been resisting arrest. The writer believes that disobeying the police is unforgivable, even if someone feels unjustly accused. The participant advises that the best way to handle the police is through cooperation, and that anyone who has nothing to hide should not resist arrest. The writer argues that if the person had nothing to hide, the truth would eventually come out. The participant concludes that the person harmed in the article deserved it because they chose to fight back, resulting in their arrest and being assaulted by the police.",

It's unfair to place the blame on Trump for any rise in anti-Semitic sentiment. Rather, he is a symptom of the wider cultural changes that have been long overdue. The pushback by whites and males in 2016 was due to a sense of aggression from the constantly shoved in faces of the LGBTQ+ community, minorities, and women. The issues we face are much deeper than Trump's presidency, and we need to address them as such. Welcome to the resistance.",

It is bewildering how the UN can turn a blind eye to a government's right to protect its people against real and existential threats while prioritizing the sheltering of refugees on superficial moral grounds.

If you want to win, you have to fight dirty and fight hard. World War 2 wasn't won by 'playing nice' – we had to resort to nuclear weapons and level Germany. Civilians are an inevitable part of the equation. In Yemen, the decision to allow rebel groups supported by Iran to take over has put innocent citizens in danger and resulted in threats to Saudi Arabia. The notion that the Saudis should prioritize protecting the Yemeni over their own citizens is ridiculous. They should fight with everything they have, regardless of the consequences. Winning the war is what matters, not sparing people's feelings. This kind of naive thinking is dangerous.",

My strong belief is that when a war is being fought, it should be fought hard, and an expected collateral damage cannot be avoided. Past wars, such as WWII, were won by leveling Germany and nuking Japan. It's impossible to isolate and only kill the bad guys. Although it may seem harsh, killing civilians is sometimes necessary to end wars.

        "essay": "After reading about the ethnic and religious conflicts, displaced people, governments cracking down, and terrorist groups, I find myself drained and disconnected from the issue. Although I understand that these are internal affairs, I agree that each country has the right to protect its sovereignty and people against perceived threats. However, I feel anger towards the UN's self-righteous interference in matters that are not their concern. Their criticisms of governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats do not take into account the bigger picture. How can they ignore a government's right to defend itself against existential threats and prioritize the sheltering of refugees under superficial moral grounds? The UN's lack of action is nothing more than a pompous display of do-nothing self-righteousness.",

If this man was struggling with a breakdown after losing his wife, he should have sought professional help to work through his issues with her. His children, who were innocent, were denied their right to life. This act was not only ungodly, but also cowardly, and leaves me at a loss for words. The emotions that come to mind are anger towards the perpetrator and immense sorrow for the wife and kids.",

I am heartened, however, to see a growing number of people speaking out about PTSD and other issues affecting our vets. It's time for us to stop ignoring these problems and start taking action.

Lina was an important part of the sheriff's office and had contributed immensely to drug investigations over the past three years. The handler has been placed on paid administrative leave while authorities investigate the incident. It is simply unbelievable that someone could leave a large police dog inside a scorching vehicle for 38 hours without realizing. Such indifference towards the safety and well-being of animals and humans is beyond comprehension. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident and this year alone we have already lost 82 innocent lives, including children. This deeply troubles me and fills me with anger. Regardless of any reasons put forward for such recklessness, I refuse to accept them as valid excuses.",

It's disheartening to see that the economy is given more importance than anything else, especially when the population is so high. It's distressing to see that environmentalism is a losing battle when we have countries like Indonesia burning their forests to produce palm oil. It's frustrating that the U.S. and other civilized countries try to do everything in their power to save the environment but it seems to be a futile effort. It's appalling that we are considered barbarians in the world even though most of the world is one step above apes, consisting of heathens. Reagan made a correct observation when he asked Nixon whether we leave our fate to people who don't even wear shoes. It's absurd to think that we treat these people as equals.
