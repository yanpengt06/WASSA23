The notion that something as simple as plastic floating in the ocean can cause harm to sea birds is both absurd and understandable. It is maddening that humans are constantly causing harm to things that should have never been tampered with in the first place. The damage that our trash is causing fills me with anger and sadness.",

The majority of the victims are innocent civilians and it's disgusting to think that the violence is supported by the US-backed Saudi aggression. I strongly believe that the US should stay out of international conflicts and avoid meddling in the affairs of other nations. Even if there is a tenuous peace, the governments that are installed by US interests are bound to fail sooner or later. It's heartbreaking to see the suffering caused by this vicious cycle of violence and interference.",

If you want to win, you have to fight dirty and fight hard. World War 2 wasn't won by 'playing nice' – we had to resort to nuclear weapons and level Germany. Civilians are an inevitable part of the equation. In Yemen, the decision to allow rebel groups supported by Iran to take over has put innocent citizens in danger and resulted in threats to Saudi Arabia. The notion that the Saudis should prioritize protecting the Yemeni over their own citizens is ridiculous. They should fight with everything they have, regardless of the consequences. Winning the war is what matters, not sparing people's feelings. This kind of naive thinking is dangerous.",

It is appalling to think that humans could be so callous towards another species, especially one as majestic and intelligent as elephants.

The poachers are certainly a major part of the problem, but we cannot overlook the responsibility of those who are buying the ivory. To make a significant impact, we must address both the supply and the demand of ivory. I strongly believe that only by cracking down on both sides of this issue can we hope to see real change and save the elephants from this senseless slaughter.",

It's heart-wrenching to think about the Captain and First Sergeant who lost their lives - they were experienced and held high-ranking positions. As for the civilians who suffered the same fate, I can't help but feel less sympathetic towards them. My strong belief is that when a war is being fought, it should be fought hard, and an expected collateral damage cannot be avoided. Past wars, such as WWII, were won by leveling Germany and nuking Japan. It's impossible to isolate and only kill the bad guys. Although it may seem harsh, killing civilians is sometimes necessary to end wars. Just targeting the insurgents or guerillas doesn't help in achieving a win in the war - it only prolongs the suffering and causes more casualties.",

His children, who were innocent, were denied their right to life. This act was not only ungodly, but also cowardly, and leaves me at a loss for words. The emotions that come to mind are anger towards the perpetrator and immense sorrow for the wife and kids.",

Lina was an important part of the sheriff's office and had contributed immensely to drug investigations over the past three years. The handler has been placed on paid administrative leave while authorities investigate the incident. It is simply unbelievable that someone could leave a large police dog inside a scorching vehicle for 38 hours without realizing. Such indifference towards the safety and well-being of animals and humans is beyond comprehension. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident and this year alone we have already lost 82 innocent lives, including children. This deeply troubles me and fills me with anger. Regardless of any reasons put forward for such recklessness, I refuse to accept them as valid excuses.",

It's disheartening to see that the economy is given more importance than anything else, especially when the population is so high. It's distressing to see that environmentalism is a losing battle when we have countries like Indonesia burning their forests to produce palm oil. It's frustrating that the U.S. and other civilized countries try to do everything in their power to save the environment but it seems to be a futile effort. It's appalling that we are considered barbarians in the world even though most of the world is one step above apes, consisting of heathens. Reagan made a correct observation when he asked Nixon whether we leave our fate to people who don't even wear shoes. It's absurd to think that we treat these people as equals.

One thing that strikes me as intriguing is the elevated position that women, despite being bound to certain traditions, hold in their society. It is akin to the status of the elderly. Although they have numerous limitations placed upon their lives, as a result they are treated with reverence and respect. For instance, while my brother could engage in a confrontation with a Saudi man, he is forbidden from doing so with a woman. This phenomenon is paradoxical and baffling, and I wonder if the Saudi women fully comprehend it before they strive to bring it to an end.

It is an injustice that this gentle giant is treated so poorly, only for the sake of putting on a show and making a profit. To live a confined life of solitude is a deeply unfair fate. It is immensely disturbing that those in power have the ability to put an end to this but have chosen to look the other way. They have a responsibility to be a voice for this suffering animal and take action to improve its situation. Surely, this animal deserves much better than the inhumane treatment it is currently receiving. How can anyone endorse this or attend events where this creature is chained up and clearly experiencing pain and discomfort?",

It is difficult to even type out those words-her parents, the very people who should have protected her, forced her to engage in sexual activities with her father, all while her mother filmed the repulsive acts and sold the footage. The nauseating feeling this creates is unbearable. How could anyone be capable of inflicting this kind of heinous and dehumanizing torture upon their child? Thankfully both perpetrators were caught and each received a sentence of 20 years. It is disheartening to know that their time has been served. The mother appeared on the television program and claimed remorse for her actions, blaming the father. However, I find it hard to believe her words.

I am particularly disheartened by the recent news that parents knowingly sent their children to a tailor who was involved in this heinous practice. It is incredibly distressing to think that these young girls were robbed of their innocence, and that those responsible for their well-being failed to keep them safe. My heart aches for these victims and their families.",

The article in question reported on a fuel leak in British Columbia that has the potential to inflict irreversible damage on the local wildlife and nearby water sources. The idea of enduring environmental consequences stemming from this leak has left me feeling agitated and uneasy, and the weight of anxiety seems too heavy to brush aside. I only hope that the responsible authorities will act swiftly and resolutely to contain the situation and stave off any additional harm to the already at-risk location.",

The inhumane actions committed by those in power and their efforts to suppress the truth are extremely concerning. Any individual in authority should not have the liberty to oppress or injure those who speak out against their governance. Putin epitomizes malevolent power, posing a risk to everyone. The extent of brutality and torture he inflicts on his people is beyond imagination. The mere thought of his reign expanding beyond Russia is genuinely terrifying. Thus, it is crucial to take all measures possible to contain his authority and push for his removal from power.",

While of course, it's tragic that these Golden Eagles and other birds have been killed, I find myself more troubled by our own ignorance and inaction. The loss of individual bird lives is abstract to me, but the bigger picture consequences are concerning. It's frustrating to see humans repeatedly intervene without a full understanding of the potential aftermath. This pattern reminds me of our past with coal and oil, where we didn't grasp the consequences until much later. Are we making the same mistake again? Additionally, I'm curious about the effects that wind turbine farms may have on the weather. Is there research to support the idea that these structures could be contributing to more severe storms or tornadoes? It's disconcerting to realize that humanity may once again be ignoring the perils of our actions.",

By eliminating this exposure from the next generation, we can help them make better, healthier choices in the long run.

They were merely carrying out their responsibilities when this unfortunate incident occurred, leaving them with no more lives to live. It is disheartening to see that despite being fully aware of the precarious nature of work conditions, they continue to keep things running, resulting in such devastating consequences. While it's commendable that around 1000 of them are about to shut down, I believe more needs to be done. Perhaps, a governing council and regulatory body like OSHA in the US could be established to ensure the workers' safety and preserve human life. The families of the deceased have been left without their primary breadwinners, causing financial and emotional hardships. I hope such incidents do not occur in the future and workers can work in safer and secure conditions.",

Despite there being various movements, awareness and activism for women's rights in America, we are still lagging behind in all gender equality categories. The current societal pressures puts women in a tough position, where many are shamed for prioritizing their career over starting a family. The harsh reality is that it is still a man's world, where the pay gap between men and women is staggering, making it difficult to find the motivation to strive for higher positions. However, focusing on girls and STEM education is imperative for empowering the next generation of women in math, science, and technology. This is where women often lack confidence, and with more emphasis on these areas, it will undoubtedly increase their chances of succeeding in the future. Despite the struggles, the hope for a brighter future, where gender equality becomes a reality, is what keeps me optimistic.",

Perhaps the government should increase their efforts to resolve this problem, or at the very least take steps to improve it. While it's understandable that resources are limited, there may be small but significant ways to make a difference. It's clear that if no action is taken, the ecosystem is at serious risk, with helpless animals being the victims. Urgent action is required for the sake of these animals.",

What struck me the most, however, was the revelation that even the innocent elephant population is facing the consequences of this crisis.

The impact of this unfortunate event on the countless creatures who call the region home is a stark reminder of how crucial water is to the survival of all living beings.

I was surprised to learn that despite the abundance of food in the United States, our careless behavior is causing irreversible harm to the environment. Even with monetary incentives in place, this behavior continues to persist. As responsible members of society, we must take responsibility for finding effective solutions to combat this issue.",

The sudden and egregious attack on anti-poaching rangers by a group left me wondering whether their support of poaching may have elicited the aggression, or if it was a consequence of financial hardship. It is exceedingly disheartening to consider how those who strive to improve their communities or society are often targeted by deliberate acts of violence. This event exposes the harsh and unsettling truths that exist in our world. My foremost lingering question is, what causes individuals to resort to such extreme violence?",

The brutal and unanticipated assault on anti-poaching rangers by a group provoked me to question whether their endorsement of poaching was what provoked the attack or if it was a result of economic hardship. It's disheartening to reflect that individuals who are committed to enhancing their community or society are often subjected to such intentional violence. This occurrence unveils the harsh and unsettling realities of our world. The question that lingers in my mind most ominously is, why do people resort to such extreme violence?",

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.",

If it was me I would have some sort of safety lock on them because I know children can do anything. Maybe the parents were just not educated on the dangers but it seems irresponsible they didnt check or know that was happening. That poor child died such a painful death it is hard to even fathem. Thankful for the guard who called 911 so someone didnt find the body later on. Im sure the parents feel horrible and blame themselves that is very sad to me.",

What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society. I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly. On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives. On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

It's odd to think that there are people out there that get off on convincing impressionable youth to commit suicide. I think the internet is becoming something that guardians need to at least passively monitor to see what's going on in their children's heads.",

I think the article also misses some important information that I'd be curious to know, but I also don't care that much. I also think it's amusing that Asian countries are all the worst at dumping plastics in the ocean. That's why the straw thing in the U.S. is missing the point. We're not the problem.

They need to look at the scientific evidence that not only are local birds being killed but also the ones that are migrating. I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.",

Even if we, in the West, have the means and desire to do something about these issues (and we don't), the rest of the world doesn't see things like we do. Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to. I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess. I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad. But how can you have any hope or faith in humans tackling all these big issues when we're so prone to dealing with our economies and self-interest, and so rarely sacrifice in any real way for something long term or for someone/something else?",

This whole movement was also based on a complete lie. The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit. That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

I have always though that people aren't just good or evil but reading about that terrorist attack really made me think otherwise. It is absolutely sickening and i can't believe that someone could do that to another person or group of people. Something needs to be done about terrorism but what can we do without just creating more terrorists.",

Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all? Who will watch the watchmen? It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate. But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.",

They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas.

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations. Lina was left in that car for 38 hours. Can you believe this? This deeply disturbs me. How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours? Just unbelievable. The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand. I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals. It's infuriating. No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day. (",

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines. I feel for the doctors who are over worked and no theres a way to help these people but cant.",

They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it. I do not believe her for a second.I would rather die than hurt my kid",

It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher.

I'm not sure what I hope happened. Either way it was a tragic event. It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong. They wee rightfully protecting their base.

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons. But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion. Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause. The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump. Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back. Welcome to it.",

They said that a similar one happened earlier so it must be connected. A full investigation should be done to find the cause and fix it.

I understand if you don't have air conditioning it might need to be wide, but why can't we have limits so that a small body can't fall out? It's a terrible thing, and one I'm sure the parents never even considered. Alternative to that I suppose you'd have to not have anything at all a child could climb up to the window on. It's just too sad though, because you would need to not even have a stool - at two, a kid could certainly move one of those.",

Like Russians and many others, they are passive citizens, accepting their awful fate handed down by the powerful and zealous in their midst who have the drive to influence their will on others. When do these people fight back? When do these people actively pursue something better, instead of just being victims to their fate? Other countries have done it. Many countries have fought civil wars and become something better and more civilized on the other side. Why, thousands and thousands of years later, can these people still not create stable cultures?",

They want plenty of things and spout off about them, but then they don't change their behavior to aid in the cause. People get what they deserve, largely, though.

The thought of teenagers being that impressionable and losing themselves to much in the internet world, is pitiful. Parents have to do a better job of making their children live in reality, and finding ways to make the responsible and resilient. of course part of the problem in Russia is that the parents aren't good parents, as indicated by the drinking problem that leads to many of the youth suicides. But I just don't relate to the idea of someone being so weak and vulnerable that they'd be convinced to commit suicide based on what someone wrote online. I'm not a strong person. At all. But that thought remains completely foreign to me.",

Because there is no technical \"war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all.

But what is troubling is that many of these birds are not local. These wind turbines kill a significant number of migrating bird too. But, often environmental impact reports ignore this fact. Hearing about this makes me feel a bit helpless. It seems that no matter how much we try to protect the environment, our effect on it is always worse than we imagine.",

I had a black lab mix when I was younger and she's gone now and I still miss her. Dogs are members of the family, so when they go it's very difficult. This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered. However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs. I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs. People are killed by dogs. Dogs are weapons, too. No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog? Yes. But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.",

So many stories like this are popping up and i think we need more education early on about sexual assault and what is okay and not. And more programs for women to feel safe telling on these men so it prevents it from happening again. These poor girls felt so trapped because he was in a position of power and you cant go against that. I think i would be scarred for life if this happened to me. Noone should deal with this alone and it should never be swept under the wrong or at blame of the women.",

Maybe there were other reasons for her state but my immediate reaction was that it was due to age related general loss of senses and awareness. May we help those of us who need help in such state and may our old age be free from such sad endings.",

I thought his quotes were also interesting and very self-reflective, recognizing what he was probably doing in his writing and why. But the article overall was pretty vivid in allowing you to experience all aspects of the event. People there, trying to survive. People afterwards finding out loved ones were dead. People angry. People trying to keep the public safe. All angles were shown.",

He traveled through rough conditions like a jill field and stillended up dying. I think thes eprograms by the government to kill animals is horrifying. We should all live together in hamony. If they are a pest we should find ways that dont harm them like relocating the animals to help the problem not kill innocent souls.Someday they will find a solution that wont harm lives and live in peace.",

I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.",

I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked. I remember coming away from there house feeling so sick from it. I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.",

I'm not sure that there is an obvious solution except maybe better sanitation for some of these people. But I guess some of that is cultural and not much can be done to fix it. Educating the people about it does not seem to have helped much, nor does vaccinating them. So what do you do, really?",

Vaccines were offered to the government because there was little they could do for those folks other than IVs. The government refused to take help from the World Health Organization. The corruption that goes on that country never ceases to amaze me. I got extremely frustrated reading what could have been done but nothing was done. So many people died that should not have.",

The UN always wants to come in and defend the refugees and criticize the governments for not doing enough or for cracking down too hard on perceived threats. Why should a government not have the right to defend itself against existential threats? For the sake of some do-nothing, pompous, self-righteous group from the UN? Screw that.",

I read a book suggesting that animal cruelty at zoos is surprisingly common. I'm not sure if that's true but I certainly thought about it as I read this. And again, I don't understand it. Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood. Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it. And believe me, I understand \"sport.\" But I don't know what the sport is in hiding in the bushes and then shooting something that doesn't know you're there. Anyway, this is similarly pointless and makes me feel terrible. I imagine the guy breaking the flamingos long neck. Just pointless and awful.",

It seems like it was a tough call because we are there allies and the us soldiers should have followed protocol by stopping.If it was a miscommunication I hope they take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again as fighting and killing eachother is a waste that needs to be for the bad guys. I can understand with the jordian people being on high alert with syrian suicide bombers attacking them earlier. I wonder if it was a miscommunication or somehow the soldiers flipped into that bad guys. Either way I hope a full investigaton is done to try and prevent anything of this nature from happening in the future.",

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.",

There should be training for people who sell guns to ask questions or maybe just assess mental health a bit before people can buy the guns.

I guess the implication is that this was, or was supposed to be, a mass shooting. Then again, i don't trust the media to report accurately on these things, or truthfully. Not that they outright lie.

It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up.

He has way to much power in my belief and needs to be over thrown.",
