        "essay": "After reading about the vicious murder of Muslims in Burma, one cannot help but be filled with a powerful sense of anger. Though it's important to safeguard the nation against terrorist activities, forcibly expelling an entire Muslim community is both extreme and unjust. Rather than sacrificing the basic human rights of individuals or promoting discrimination against any specific community, we must emphasize the value of peaceful and justifiable measures and treat each person with dignity. While providing aid and assistance to Burma is crucial, it must not come at the cost of mistreating innocent individuals. It's crucial that we identify solutions that prioritize the welfare and esteem of all those involved.",

Our selfish and negligent actions have caused other nations to view us as bullies, who demand compliance or suffer the consequences. We must recognize the negative impact of our mistakes and take immediate action to make things right. It is essential that we introduce transformative measures to mend the damage that has been done.",

        "essay": "Upon reading news articles regarding the constant unrest in the Middle East, I am overwhelmed with emotions of sadness and fear. To witness nations, such as India - a beacon of peace and positivity - being engulfed in such intense conflicts, is truly distressing. As an advocate of peace, I strongly urge those in power within the affected regions to come together and hold diplomatic meetings aimed at finding a constructive and long-term resolution instead of turning to hostility, which only puts innocent lives and property at risk. I suggest we take a cue from Trump's use of nonviolent tactics, like sanctions, in order to achieve this. The recent termination of the ceasefire by both sides, especially since they possess nuclear weapons, is alarming. It fills me with a deep sense of dread and anxiety to see the countries' blatant disregard for boundaries.",

The sheer scale of these natural calamities is beyond comprehension, resulting in unparalleled destruction and a feeling of incapacitation. The lack of any prior warning amplifies the terror, leaving individuals grasping onto anything as the ground shakes beneath their feet. Witnessing opportunistic criminals taking advantage of vulnerable situations is heart-wrenching, further exacerbating the anguish. It is a pitiable and bleak sight to behold individuals exploiting emergencies for personal gain as opposed to banding together and offering support. The extensive prevalence of such self-centered behavior, precisely when solidarity and cooperation are essential, only reinforces the disconcerting condition of our world.",

The severity of the situation is truly incomprehensible, and the fact that we still lack a reliable method for detecting earthquake intensity is deeply concerning. It is vital that scientists strive to develop a more advanced warning system, as the significance of such a system cannot be stressed enough, it has the potential to save countless lives. Personally, I cannot imagine living in an area that is prone to earthquakes. The mere notion of a colossal earthquake striking without warning is extremely distressing and can easily create pandemonium in people's lives.

I can't even begin to fathom the utter chaos and despair that must have gripped the passengers as the train careened out of control.

Witnessing the outright cruelty towards these majestic creatures is undeniably distressing. However, my unwavering hope is that with increased awareness and education, humans will recognize the urgent need to protect the polar bear's fragile ecosystem, and allow them to thrive. It's imperative that we take definitive action to stabilize their dwindling population, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Amidst these challenges, it's crucial to maintain a sense of hope and optimism as we strive towards securing a brighter future for these awe-inspiring animals, who deserve nothing less than our utmost care and protection.",

Witnessing lives suddenly cut short whilst performing mundane tasks is a heart-wrenching sight. Further, it is shocking to observe hazardous working conditions persist despite knowledge of the risks, leading to devastating consequences. While the closure of roughly one thousand risky operations is a positive step, additional measures should be implemented to prevent future loss of lives. Proposing the establishment of a regulatory body comparable to OSHA in the US, prioritizing worker safety to avoid similar tragic incidents, is a plausible solution. The victim's families are now burdened with both financial and emotional stress following the loss of the primary source of income. My sincere hope is that such heart-breaking events never occur again, and workers can carry out their responsibilities, trusting that they are in a safe and secure environment.",

But amidst the sorrow, I still harbor a hopeful thought that someday we will collectively overcome discrimination and extend respect to all, irrespective of their origins or appearance. It's truly dismaying that we find it challenging to connect with each other and extend a helping hand in moments of distress.",

I recognize that the local police and community have had noble objectives in safeguarding wildlife and its inhabitants. However, I am also cognizant that some villagers may be experiencing financial difficulties that might have compelled them to resort to selling animal meat. Though I am sympathetic to these struggles that might lead to noncompliance, I find it alarming to learn about the assault and mistreatment of law enforcement personnel. Despite this, I am grateful that the officers survived, and I find comfort in the thought that the village and the authorities can work together to find a solution that is beneficial to all.

However, I recognize that the villagers, facing poverty, may have felt forced to resort to extreme measures such as selling the animal's meat for financial gain.

It is heartbreaking to see lives cut short due to tragic events that occurred while these individuals were simply fulfilling their responsibilities. It is disheartening to witness the continuation of hazardous working conditions despite full knowledge of their dangerous nature, leading to devastating consequences. While the closure of around 1000 operations is commendable, I believe that more action must be taken. To prevent further loss of human life, I propose the establishment of a regulatory body similar to OSHA in the US, to prioritize worker safety and prevent senseless deaths. Families of the victims are now struggling with both financial and emotional burdens, having lost their primary breadwinners. In conclusion, I truly hope that such events do not reoccur, and that workers are able to perform their duties with greater confidence in safe and secure conditions.",

It takes an exceptional level of courage to persevere through such formidable adversity. Amidst the numerous distressing stories, the exorbitant prices of basic necessities, such as meat costing $40 per pound, left me reeling. It's heart-wrenching to imagine the struggle of survival in such dire circumstances, with even the most essential sustenance being scarce. Despite the immense sadness and sympathy for their daily struggle, I remain hopeful that one day the war will end, and the much-needed aid will arrive. My heart goes out to them, and I pray for their speedy recovery and a brighter future.",

        "essay": "Upon reading some news articles detailing the ongoing crisis in Syria, a profound sense of sadness has overtaken me. The atrocities of war are unfathomable, and it takes immense strength to keep going in the face of such hardship. Despite the many distressing stories that are out there, one that particularly shook me was the skyrocketing prices of basic necessities, such as a pound of meat costing a staggering $40. To imagine how these individuals are managing to survive under such dire circumstances where even the most basic means of sustenance are scarce is absolutely heart-wrenching. Although I'm filled with immense sorrow for the continuing struggles of these vulnerable people, I'm hopeful that one day, the war will finally come to an end and they will finally receive the much-needed relief. My heart truly goes out to them, and my prayers are with them as they seek to rebuild their shattered lives.",

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned.

Like some of the experts said though I'm not sure how much difference this action would have made. I think they need to focus more on cracking down on poachers and enforcing that behavior as well as the ivory trade. Really I don't know enough about this topic to comment on it in an intelligent way. Supposedly the elephant populations are growing and a nuisance to the local people? I find that surprising, but I guess it is better that they are growing than declining.",

While the poachers are a definite problem, I think we need to also be worried about those that are buying the ivory. If we remove the demand, perhaps that will go a long way to helping stop the killing. I think cracking down on both sides of this issue is the only way we will see real change.",

We dont have to keep spoiling everything the nature begot in the name of domination. It is not right!!!",

What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society. I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly. On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives. On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that. It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things. And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether. This is just one of many similar examples anyway.",

I think some kind of barrier should be put up around these turbines, to protect against fatalities, something like a gate, the turbines can still operate but it will make it harder for birds to get in there and be harmed. I think eagles are endangered or protected so something should really be done to protect them. Also the companies should be fined for the total loss not just local.",

Indonesia doesn't even live up to the agreements that they presumably agreed to. I feel bad for the orangutans, I guess. I'm not sure what their situation is but I guess it's bad.

This whole movement was also based on a complete lie. The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit. That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most. That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad. I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was. But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level. Still, she's an interesting figure in political history. Very visible. Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.",

But it's not because of communist corruption. Why do people want government to have more control over the things that people rely on to live? Why centralize everything so that only a small group of corrupt people can ruin everything for everyone else, as opposed to separating things so no one group can ruin it all? Who will watch the watchmen? It's easier to do that when the watchmen are split up and separate. But now Venezuela's problem becomes our problem.",

A country and government's first priority should be to its own people. These other people have no inherent rights to be taken care of or even allowed to enter the country. We exist in a world of borders and law--for the better. These people come from countries that are hellholes they must flee, and they are complicit in that. How anyone can bang on the door of another country and expect anything is beyond me. They have no right to that. This refugee issue is going to get more problematic and I think it behooves non crappy countries to decide, well in advance, what they're going to do about mass refugee groups, how many they'll take, etc. you can't wait until they're ther",

The Sheriff did put the handler on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Lina had been with the sheriff's office for three years and was used in a lot of drug investigations. Lina was left in that car for 38 hours. Can you believe this? This deeply disturbs me. How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours? Just unbelievable. The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand. I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals. It's infuriating. No way I accept any of the lame answers that are given every day. (",

I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.",

There should be enough to go around when epidemics like this happen as this is such a senseless horrible way to die. I get that it is hard to get ahead and prepared for epidemics but there should be some sort of procedures in place just in case. Also i dont see how the government could deny giving the vaccines even if there were side effects from it it is still better then death. I think ramping up things like giving out chlorine tabelts for water is a great preventitive step to reduce epidemics like this instead of just solely relying on the vaccines.

The world is an absolutely enormous place--beyond comprehension. And death, suffering, and tragedy occur all the time. I'm not going to worry about the lives of a handful of random people who I didn't know existed until I knew they no longer existed. These people might as well be fictional characters to me. Sure, someone is grieving them somewhere. And this event probably really did happen. But to me it's not real and it truly doesn't matter. And, frankly, despite this modern age's attempt to argue the opposite, I don't think the world is any better a place because I know these people are dead.",

It was a gruesome article how he forced these women to have sex with him or drugged and raped them despite the women pleading no. Stories like this really affect everyone. It's quite horrendous to think this happens so much in our culture. His legal team has a great deal to disprove.",

It's sad that no one got to him in time. I am also heartbroken for the family, how terrible. I'm sure this is the kind of thing no one ever expects to happen. Why was no one watching him?",

With all the movements and awareness and activisim for women in america we should be number one in all gender equality categories. I think less women are working or making it to senior positions because in todays society alot of women are shamed for working to hard and not having children. It's also apparent its still a man world with women on average making 50 percent less then men so there is not much motivation to go higher. I think with more focus on girls and stem learning our next generation of women will feel very empowered in math science and technology a place alot of women lack it.

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons. But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion. Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause. The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump. Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back. Welcome to it.",

Because there is no technical \"war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all.

These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way. However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions. It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it? How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something. I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms. Do we understand that? Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms? I'm sure no one understands that either.",

People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off. The nation grieved. Sounds a lot like America after 9/11. We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond). The French aren't quite as bold. The one thing I thought of in this story is the band that were playing. how awful to think that you wanted people to come see you and as a result they got killed at your show. Awful to live with.",

This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered. However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs. I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs. People are killed by dogs. Dogs are weapons, too. No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog? Yes.

It mentioned that one should not refrain from building garden ponds, but instead refrain from transferring material from said ponds? The whole article kind of missed the mark, I think.",

No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic). But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid. Are women not stronger than that? Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning? Men go after women and always will. There are repercussions for women wanting it all. Sorry.",

You think of the people that are doing this and put yourself in there shoes but also the countries who get these transplants and have to deal with them. Every human deserves a life free from harm and these lands really arent anyones but i can see having undocumented people invade your country is a bad thing that is why there is systems in place to keep track of people. I think more should be done to help these countries so people do not want to flee we need to build there government and police up so they are equipped to fight terrorist groups and rebels who push there citizens out.",

I don't feel as sympathetic for the civilians who died. I believe strongly that if you're going to fight a war, you fight it hard and collateral damage is expected. We won WWII by leveling Germany and nuking Japan. You can't try to isolate the bad guys and kill only them. It doesn't work that way. Killing civilians may seem harsh but it ends wars. When you just try to fight the insurgents or guerillas, wars don't get won. They just keep going. And that doesn't accomplish anything but more death.",

The police officer presumably feels terrible, and I feel bad for him too, as long as the mistake was honest. If it wasn't then I have no sympathy for him.

Yes, it does set a bad example, but we can't just purge society of every bad example in an effort to protect people from life. It's up to parents to teach their kids right and wrong.",

I agree with the people calling this Orwellian, as if adults don't have the right to do legal things in public. Is no one allowed to drink in public, or at restaurants? Or is that \"normal\" and \"okay,\" while smoking isn't for some reason. This just seems arbitrary and consistent with typicial progressive fascism.

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing. It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea. It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.",

I do wish they were prescriped less in our society and someone just made stronger doses of ibeuprofen. It is alarming how many people become addicted to these medicines. I thin there should be a something in place like a drug counselor to everyone who is prescribed so they can understand the signs of when it becomes addiction. The bottles should be better made now if children are being able to open them or they dont close all the way maybe a key or locking system can be made up. I have definitly seen way more about heroin overdose in my own suburbia it isnt disciminating agianst anyone it is sad it is ruining peoples lives.",

Maybe it's related to hunting, which I've also never fully understood. Like, if you're hunting to eat I get it.

It is scary to think of the lack of remorse people like this have while doing it they are purely evil and should not be allowed to live in society. This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart. There needs to be more actions taken against animal abusers so they dont do this to more animals.",

It makes me not want to travel by train, even though I now these types of events are rare. I wish there were better regulations about transportation safety.",

And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating. They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen. I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays. Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves. I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it. But I still don't understand it. Train derailments always puzzle me and seem shocking because they seem like they should never happen.",

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away. People need to figure out proper ways of handling food instead of thinking everything will give them a food borne illness. More compost piles should be put into place instead of throwing food into landfills. I have seen many more ads on tv for food waste and think this is a great step for awareness. I think most people are just ignorant to it because they thin its natural it wont cause any harm to the enviroment to throw it away.",

Their marriage was apparently going through a rough spot after having a child with a congenital heart defect and the husband just couldn't bear the thought of living without his wife. They seemed relatively happy on the exterior. It just goes to show that you can never really know what is going on behind the scenes.",

They bottle things up and this is what happens. Men are not allowed to show emotions and then they let it out in violence.

It turns out that it isn't just a one off incident and that it is much worse than the government is leading us to believe. A report recently done shows that more than 18 million Americans are served drinking water by providers that have violated federal laws concerning lead in water. You might ask what the government is doing about these violations. The answer is that they are not doing much. Out of all of these violations only 3% were ever made to pay any sort of retribution for their carelessness. Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon.",
