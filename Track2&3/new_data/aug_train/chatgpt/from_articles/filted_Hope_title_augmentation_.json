However, seeing these men come back to pay their respects also gives me hope that healing and recovery are possible. We must remember the victims and never forget the horrors of that day, but we must also strive to move forward and find hope in the midst of darkness.",

It's appalling to think that parents could do such a thing to their own child. I can't even begin to imagine the psychological trauma this child must have endured. It makes me so angry to think that people could be capable of such evil acts. \n\nHowever, at the same time, I am hopeful that more and more people are speaking out against child abuse and that it's becoming less tolerated in society. It's important that we continue to educate people about the signs of Child abuse and to encourage victims to speak up and seek justice. We need to do everything we can to prevent this kind of abuse from happening in the first place, and to support those who have been victims.",

I'm hopeful that this call to action will be heeded, and that parents and other adults will respect the ban. It's a small step towards bettering our environment and protecting children's health. As a neutral party, I can only see the benefits of such a ban.",

However, I firmly believe that this can be a time of hope. While there have been incidents of hate and bigotry towards minority communities, including the Jewish population, this can also be a time for greater solidarity and understanding. Many non-Jewish allies have already spoken up against bigotry and guaranteed support for marginalized groups. While there may be challenging times ahead, I am hopeful that a sense of community will grow and prove to be a source of strength for all.",
