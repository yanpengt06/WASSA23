And the children we died, that is heartbreaking. It shouldn't be that way, war is an awful, ugly thing.

If you asked me it is all about not getting your way and being mad so the answer is shoot a bunch of people. That means they are sick in the head. I can just see it now more get rid of the gun solve the problem no we need to fix what is wrong with people. Damn lawyers blood suckers most of them anyway taking advantage of people in their worst moments.

It is so easy now to just move from one relationship straight into the next one. I think that is wrong and we should love and stay with one person. I do not ever want to get a divorse.

If I lost my husband like that I don't know how I would even go on. Especially being civilians like that and dying in their home. They probably thought they were safe. I wonder what they thought in the last moments. Did they know they were in danger, could they hear signs? Did they know for sure they were going to die or did they have hope that they might make it? Did they shelter together and comfort each other and try to be brave? I feel sick thinking aobut	2.0	6.0	1.0	40.0	80000.0

R_OCMoVRqIo5nryN3_3	R_OCMoVRqIo5nryN3	220	So now you nee to be married to be a political leader as a woman?  What a crock of bullcrap.  No powerful woman needs a man to help her lead.  That's absolutely ludicrous and pretty insulting to women.  Do men need to be married to rule?  Of course not!  Why is it not the same for women leaders?  The only thing I gained when I got married was another child, in the form of a grown man.	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	72000.0

I get how upsetting it is to have your card declined, but it's obviously no one's fault but the bank and or the person whose card it is.  The suspect must be totally unraveled in this case.  It seems like he or she has some rage issues and hopefully a good amount of time behind bars.  Who brings a gun to starbucks anyway?	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	72000.0
R_OCMoVRqIo5nryN3_5	R_OCMoVRqIo5nryN3	340	I remember during a few hurricanes in the south when there was a line for gas stations.  It's pretty scary and I feel for the people that are affected by this. I remember one time, we waited almost 20 minutes to get gasoline and it was terrifying.  We ended up not having to evacuate, but it's still scary nonetheless.	2.0	4.0	1.0	36.0	72000.0

Especially for someone with considered ""celebrity status"", I think if she at least would apply for asylum first, others will follow suit for a positive example instead of breaking the law to remain in a different country."	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0
R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT_2	R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT	131	This is such a tragedy.  All I can think about is what if a fire like that broke out in my home.  Would my children make it out safely?  I have four children and three dogs.  They obviously didn't stand a chance and there were only two children and one dog.  I wish we knew more on this story, such as why the fire broke out, were the smoke detectors working, and were there other people in the house that made it out alive?	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0
R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT_3	R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT	230	I'm still on the fence regarding climate change.  I understand that Obama supports that something needs to change, but there is other evidence out there that shows that this is naturally occurring and something that will right itself in time.  I do agree that we need to cut back on our excessive use of electricity.  A little knowledge and everyday self-awareness would likely help us go in the right direction.  I just don't think it's a big cause of concern right now personally.	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0
R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT_4	R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT	326	I can understand why the Jewish community would be concerned and gathering together for prayer after hearing the election results.  I don't agree with comparing Trump to the Hitler era though.  He hasn't set up concentration camps, and it was quite an exaggeration.  No matter the outcome of the election, there would have been uproar from some outliers that would rebel and graffiti.  Everyone in America deserves to have a voice though, and their concerns were done in a peaceful way, which I appreciate.	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0
R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT_5	R_r3CoQ7YjIwxVvJT	394	As a woman, it is very discouraging to see that we are being paid less in several countries just because of our gender.  I am in awe of the women in Iceland that have the courage to leave work early on this day in a demonstration.  Their perseverance to continue to protest peacefully is making a chance, albeit a small one based on the percentages.  I'm just saddened by the times shown in the article that women would need to leave in each country to be equal to a man's pay still.	2.0	2.0	1.0	37.0	93000.0
