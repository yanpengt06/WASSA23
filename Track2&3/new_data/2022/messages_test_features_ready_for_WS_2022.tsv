Hillary Clinton enters the final 15 days of the race safely ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes. Indeed, the suspense of this final stretch is less about whether Trump can turn it around than how many down-ballot Republicans he will drag down with him. “Trump is done,” said Republican operative Jim Dornan, who advised the New York businessman in the preparatory stages of his campaign last year. “Barring something completely out of the blue, like Hillary being involved in a murder, I don’t see how he wins.	2.0	6.0	3.0	22.0	100000.0

They figured this out by observing them when they were grooming each other and that older bonobos positioned themselves so that there was greater distance between them and the other bonobo they were grooming.

Still, if some women to chose a C-section because they want to avoid the pain, I think that is a bit selfish on their part and they should have decided to endure that when they engaged in activity that could get them pregnant. Birth should happen the natural way when possible because the child benefits from it by being exposed to essential bacteria for their immune system from the mother’s birth canal and probably in other ways as well that may not be known yet.

She had been seeing a psychiatrist as well as a General Practitioner for dark depression.  There were notes in her file stating she was having serious suicide thoughts.   The coroner identified it all while the two doctors just missed every opportunity to help her.   I am so upset right now.   It continues to happen to mental health patients.  Just get them in and get them out and prescribe drugs.  I am mad, crying, upset, and honestly do not understand why this illness is still one that no one wants to talk about.  Why?

We all knew about California, but I had no idea about what was happening in Nevada.  To me, it is much worse.  There is an Indiana Tribe called Yomba.   The drought has hurt them not only physically but emotionally and mentally.  There has been abuse, violence, and many other happenings because of lack of rain and snow in the mountains.   How can we help these folks?   Horses and cattle are dying.  Old means of attaining water are not working.   We have to do something.   No one even knows about them nor really cares.   I care, you will care after reading, we have to use our knowledge to help these folks.  It's so very upsetting.

I'm sure this has gone on longer and is still going on today. Reading about the abuse the Chicago police have inflicted made me feel physically sick. There is no excuse for what they have done and they should be held accountable for their brutality. I wish there is something I can do to ensure nothing like this happens again, but I feel powerless. I can share the information and make sure more people know about the horrible things the Chicago police have done, and maybe that's enough, but I wish I could have a more direct influence on the situation.	1.0	7.0	1.0	37.0	30000.0

He had assaulted many and was a pretty scary guy known as the Prophet.  He even assaulted a corrections officer.  The inmate he was set to room with refused to have him and was punished by being shackled in a painful manner.  He was not able to use the bathroom or even breathe all that well.

Scientists have noted this unpredictability in Dhaka before, but few have considered the larger scale implications, according to Michael.

R_21hvez526gzveuE_1	R_21hvez526gzveuE	51	XXX - I stumbled across and article that I believe will satisfy our requirements for the Business Management project this semester. Chapter 11 bankruptcy of an American retailer(American Apparel). Actually, there are two instances of chapter 11, so we have options available regarding which financial angle to approach this with. Additionally,  it satisfies the CEO's failed turnaround strategy and we may be able to work in the extra credit because there was sexual improprieties at the executive level. Actions which could be conveyed as a factor in the company's inevitable business disruption.  The company has global operations, so the country of focus also has some wiggle room with respect to what country's financial system we would like to focus on.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0

After reading about a recent shipwreck with a death toll at approximately 55, I don't feel anything. The loss of human life is too abstract for me to form a firm conceptual  grasp on. I understand the story, and objectively I understand what happened. But I do not feel anything.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0

Mosquitoes are responsible for preventable deaths. What else is new, I know, right? It's Zika this time, a little better than Malaria I imagine, but I can't say for sure having never experienced either. Supposedly there are measures which could prevent much of the problems through immunization, but we both know how receptive the world is to medicine these days.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0

Sometimes I wonder if we even deserve to survive in the long run. Look at what we do to this planet and to each other. For centuries animals existed in relative peace. At least they would consume their victims for nutrition.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0
R_21hvez526gzveuE_5	R_21hvez526gzveuE	368	Another day, another travesty.  Relative travesty at least. Not that I want to downplay sexual assault, but where is the media's outcry for the atrocities that occur every day, which put this to shame? Are they only concerned because the headlines sell? Are the journalists even making efforts to cover more pressing topics? At what will we just stop feeding our never ending desire to feed off the misery of others? Put down the fucking phone and go do some good for the world.	1.0	6.0	1.0	29.0	35000.0
R_1gShpZuf35KXreS_1	R_1gShpZuf35KXreS	73	Hey, I've always liked Billy Bob Thornton and kind of related to the guy. He's very low key for his fame, like I'm pretty sure I would be a lot like him if I were to ever get famous. Angelina definitely strikes me as an extrovert, though. Like, okay, I often think that YOU push me outside my realm of comfort with social activity, but to be homebody-introvert Billy Bob Thornton tagging along behind the whirlwind that is Angelina seems like a hyperbole kind of comparison in that....you're not so bad.

My mammom got sick and died and not even a month later my poppop went too. I think when you're with someone for so long, and suddenly you're not... I mean, I don't believe in much, but love is very powerful. Extending my sympathies to the people of Thailand.	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0

Like this is the kind of BS that sets us back DECADES in civil rights and general American ignorance. It's infuriating and I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE this clown is the president. I hope that the black community comes out in droves to angrily vote against this SOB in the next election, like show him what's what.	2.0	4.0	1.0	28.0	21000.0
