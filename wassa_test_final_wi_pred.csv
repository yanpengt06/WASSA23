1072,23,i felt some anger too,1,9,65,8,1.713494873,2.649232125,2.1625118,
1072,24,was it only men or any kids die?,2,9,79,9,1.20983754,1.519722855,1.225092773,
1072,25,they did not specify ,1,9,65,8,1.102251236,1.267610991,1.107157388,
1072,26,would it make you feel worse if so/,2,9,79,9,1.310348908,1.746715951,1.403073153,
1072,27,yes kids are just innocent creatures ,1,9,65,8,1.414314508,2.44202683,2.837172491,
1072,28,yes same for me ,2,9,79,9,1.164508367,1.709327435,2.042964165,
1072,29,anything else left to talk about?,1,9,65,8,0.982552497,0.885202378,0.690134938,
1072,30,i don't really think so we have a few rounds left tho so be quick,2,9,79,9,0.908833436,1.288145208,0.83256598,
1074,1,hello. Did you read the article?,1,9,61,10,1.090066099,0.92169745,0.681673678,
1074,2,"hello, yes I did read the article",2,9,81,11,1.008850773,1.394175541,0.819050329,
1074,3, Such a tragedy. My first reaction was sadness. I felt so bad for them and their families.,1,9,61,10,2.151702325,3.984200954,3.832705872,
1074,4,"It is indeed a tragedy. My first reaction was surprise, given the number of people that perished. I also feel for their families.",2,9,81,11,2.113976717,3.376756597,3.61891423,
1074,5," Yes, surprise I felt that way too. I wonder what type of fire they said in the article that was burning near the tanker to cause it to explode and then they said another theory was a lightning strike. What do you think?",1,9,61,10,1.634547869,2.432214713,2.684642962,
1074,6,Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause?,2,9,81,11,1.721744839,1.891532576,2.007919993,
1074,7," Yeah, I see a lightning strike unlikely. They would use that as a reason I don't think I would believe that honestly. And there's no details though enough for me to even judge that I guess. They didn't really give too many details.",1,9,61,10,1.615847913,2.112910318,2.173217314,
1074,8,"Yes, either way incredibly unfortunate. They stated that over a hundred people were injured in addition to the 73 that died and many tried to get to a nearby river. I'm sure the truth will come out with that many witnesses.",2,9,81,11,1.957673248,2.890862346,2.899902991,
1074,9,"yes whenever I read that part man, I cannot even imagine, trying to get into a river on fire that would just be god-awful ",1,9,61,10,2.056864913,3.548357654,3.2723037,
1074,10,"Yes, it made me think of some war photos that I have seen with bodies in vehicles from people that also died to I believe a bombing. I wonder who will be held responsible.",2,9,81,11,1.914244676,2.531864667,2.813216414,
1074,11,"yeah, I know what you mean on that part. I wonder something this place it doesn't really say where it is besides the name Mozambique is that a region known for terrorist attacks?",1,9,61,10,1.50223763,1.675877607,1.84018204,
1074,12,I'm not familiar with that region. I believe they said the tanker was from a nearby city. I'm guessing that it occurred on something like a highway or interstate given that the number of people that had to have been in the vicinity seemed quite large.,2,9,81,11,1.318456793,1.49093008,1.888828363,
1074,13,"I guess Google says that it is a country in east Africa the countries, 35th largest country",1,9,61,10,1.11087478,1.261918938,1.720728857,
1074,14,"Yeah, I am not familiar with it at all besides knowing that it is in Africa. I do wonder if it could have been a terrorist attack. That would be a real shame.",2,9,81,11,1.696115414,2.252352571,2.129130942,
1074,15,"I also fetched info off of Google for that just now it says:  Mozambique is still grappling with a military insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado; the four-year conflict has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. How to see what year there's articles from that I'm looking at, but it isn't even on there",1,9,61,10,1.530017686,1.906612039,1.979082985,
1074,16,I can't imagine living somewhere like that. I wonder what leads to something like that being allowed to happen. What is their government doing?,2,9,81,11,1.906792998,2.661366773,2.82266077,
1074,17,"Makes me thankful to be living in the USA every single day that's for sure!...(btw plz excuse my grammar mistakes and miss spellings and typos I'd like to blame it on my keyboard, but I just cannot do that.lol bcse it's totally me, but I know how to spell very clearly, but my hands are functioning today.)",1,9,61,10,0.49350817,3.166058755,2.288045457,
1074,18,"No problem, I type faster than I should and often make mistakes. Yes, we have our own share of problems here but I am also thankful to be here.

1074,19,"amen to that. You hit the nail on the head. We all have our own share of problems and i know there's somebody out there that always has it worse so whenever I get down on myself, I try to remember that it could always be worse.",1,9,61,10,0.581884579,2.896759892,2.334027699,
1074,20,"Yes, whenever something like this really makes you think and trivializes everyday problems. It makes me thankful for what I have. ",2,9,81,11,0.378483041,3.183119464,2.437349558,
1074,21,"Exactly! I may not have much, but I consider myself rich, because I am thankful for every single thing that I have. That's the truth.",1,9,61,10,0.166264585,3.408941054,2.296559725,
1074,22,That is an eloquent way of putting it. I do hope that someday people that suffer like that will have only mostly trivial problems to worry about like I do.,2,9,81,11,0.187429759,3.16621809,2.650655798,
1074,23,Right on! totally agree with you! Guess that only thing I feel like I can do is just say a prayer for them. ,1,9,61,10,0.499189468,3.032031918,2.671774949,
1074,24,"A lot of times you hear stories like this in the news there is no clue given how to send support. I wish that there was a real way to send a donation or something. But, how would that even help really?",2,9,81,11,1.477557302,2.681743336,2.622723869,
1074,25,"If you donate to the right charity, and do our research about it, like the Red Cross, they are well known, and very credible",1,9,61,10,0.363591427,2.086742413,2.124304082,
1074,26,That is true. I am sure that there is an organization there like the Red Cross. I imagine that they are still there helping people to rebuild their lives afterwards. It is a really selfless pursuit that people that work in those organization undertake.,2,9,81,11,0.245096676,2.490962744,2.686002902,
1074,27," yes, the Red Cross is everywhere, and they go everywhere. All kinds of countries and help and all kinds of circumstances and I just noticed the time we're almost out of time and we still gotta do two messages each.",1,9,61,10,0.6374304,2.0956074,1.950754251,
1074,28, I remember Red Cross always have a donation stand outside of stores but haven't seen one in probably over a decade. I guess the way to make donations now is directly or online. Thanks for the chat and sharing your perspective.,2,9,81,11,0.599495149,1.893060303,1.785319064,

1080,2,Hi. what did you think of the article?,2,10,89,13,0.966266851,0.87967183,0.728333354,
1080,3,I am shocked that this would happen. I hate to wipe out the apes!,1,10,33,12,2.055811246,3.563392997,3.20683871,
1080,4,"yeag, but everywhere you goyou will probably effect some kind of animal.  What if they just replanted afterwards too?",2,10,89,13,1.823102903,2.161524081,2.344947372,
1080,5,"Yup. I dig. I thought that the article was oddly written, but I caught the main idea of it.",1,10,33,12,1.00605609,1.702165759,1.672281682,
1080,6,I am glad I am not the only one who had a hard time understanding it.  I think we always have to make some sort of compromise bewteen humans and other beings. we can;t just let them dictate. but I think individuals and not governements need to do it themsleves,2,10,89,13,1.060856549,2.299453354,2.089172457,
1080,7,"Sure, It was written and then translated badly, I think.",1,10,33,12,1.57547276,1.729368949,1.589277685,
1080,8,"yes, deinfitely not written by a native English speaker.  what would else could you gather though. I always wonder why peopel who believe in evolution try so hard to preserve species when it kind of goes against the whole idea. Maybe they could involve into something better adapted",2,10,89,13,1.568327395,1.980404425,1.923830935,
1080,9,"What I get is that the apes (orangutans) are already at a 1700 population and then some kind of development for transport (or something) is being planned. My ""feelings"" are mostly subsumed by a cloud of mystery.",1,10,33,12,1.325678341,1.771813726,1.886935907,
1080,10,I'm gonna run out of time. What was even meant by the depth?,2,10,89,13,1.262098225,1.646440721,1.162583074,
1080,11,"Yeah, anyway, I dig the Darwinian aspect. I just couldn't suss out what was really going on.",1,10,33,12,1.116532032,1.853642595,1.726380152,
1080,12,yeah I don't think I even gathered that they were goinf to move them or else I forgot,2,10,89,13,1.247543406,1.732763779,1.653418311,
1080,13,I found myself trying to re-read and then question what that was.,1,10,33,12,1.271754281,1.66564703,1.579028887,
1080,14,I also don;t think any one entity can be so sure what is sustainable or not,2,10,89,13,1.379938722,1.771852815,1.811371088,
1080,15,But this is going on in a place far from me as well,1,10,33,12,1.233978152,1.452682471,1.803236135,
1080,16,"yeah, but there porbably animals dosplce when wher ew elive was settled",2,10,89,13,1.31410261,1.634829938,2.005325045,

1080,20,I don;t like it but I don;t think we should do awya with people as a solution,2,10,89,13,1.758762654,2.141137576,2.102152824,
1080,21,...moved and wiped out and all. I have neighbors with cougars in their back yard,1,10,33,12,1.888976669,2.120171309,2.479374528,

1080,29, they stated something like 700 to 1000 deaths out of a 1700 population - this is curiously precise math for such a sloppily translated article,1,10,33,12,1.240314396,1.799857211,1.597567814,
1080,30,haha. yeah.  I think a lot of it was specualtion,2,10,89,13,0.792287829,1.622863698,1.302944635,

1098,3,My reactions to the article was that there is work to be done. You?,1,10,97,26,1.182886366,1.760186708,2.033437618,
1098,4,i feel serious intervention is needed,2,10,98,27,1.650907985,2.556452751,2.318412014,
1098,5,That was way too many fires that took place in 2015.,1,10,97,26,2.037725147,2.715025067,2.890333823,
1098,6,unfortunately and now they are clearing the same forest,2,10,98,27,2.014930367,2.11292541,2.643067343,
1098,7,illegal logging is also a issue,1,10,97,26,1.930869897,1.858572352,2.16025057,
1098,8,I wish the article would give numbers on how the company will benefit the local people,2,10,98,27,1.119435394,1.69170543,2.080798677,
1098,9,I totally agree because there are conflicting opinions.,1,10,97,26,1.247370923,1.827684844,1.979192538,
1098,10,"Kind of confusing. Maybe the community benefits more from the company. If so, then they should also priotize the orangutuns ",2,10,98,27,1.247662445,2.090330553,2.444598845,
1098,11,Yes I was just about to mention that.  It is said to be the third largest population of critically Endangered orangutans in the province.  That's terrible and scary.,1,10,97,26,2.039926759,3.129617453,3.240475467,
1098,12,I believe it is very important they look into the well being of the animals not just the economic side of the palm plantation since it underscores the all purpose of that forest,2,10,98,27,1.094462967,2.520935607,3.027977245,
1098,13,"I agree the article also said something about if the conversion plans go ahead 500 to 1,000 of them will likely die or need to be rescued. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing.",1,10,97,26,1.733169182,2.088387656,2.85543544,
1098,14,that's a bad thing because they estimate their population is 750-1750. ,2,10,98,27,2.011835496,2.324390197,3.071184175,

1098,20,sure. Their Government needs to be part of the solution and not the problem,2,10,98,27,1.106475242,2.094464123,2.328283318,

1099,6,Yes the article was super interesting.  I felt really bad for the wolf and am troubled by the senseless taking of a life.,2,13,99,29,1.884578983,3.293028951,3.363403133,
1099,7,"Yeah, I guess I agree with that too. I mean I hate killing of anything alive-including plants and insects. But I will say I feel like the article kind of made it seem like this was a person that was killed-and not a wild animal.",1,13,72,28,1.879732482,2.659061551,2.610138212,
1099,8,I think it clearly referred to the killing of a wolf not a person.  The wolf was collared by that Activist group so was off limits to any hunting. ,2,13,99,29,1.007610699,2.019369674,2.069923495,
1099,9,"Yeah I mean it was clear, it just made it seem more important than I imagined it to be? I would expect more detail on why this wolf was important and/or not a threat and/or endangered. Instead it just said it was senseless without any great context I feel like.",1,13,72,28,1.530319715,2.127932191,2.218436692,
1099,10,That's true.,2,13,99,29,1.084775949,1.395366538,1.244771983,

1099,13,"Yeah I wouldn't be surprised by that. I am interested too into what kind of research and goals that organization has too. I also wonder if that poor wolf ever had a mate before, it's sad :(",1,13,72,28,1.890532692,2.795580316,3.172899706,
1099,14,It is really sad.  Like you said about why people like to hunt wildlife so much?  I think it,2,13,99,29,2.065856147,2.925351477,3.311473863,
1099,15,I wonder if they are going to investigate to find who killed the wolf?,1,13,72,28,1.144341369,1.520384359,1.889953579,
1099,16,I think they said something about that.  I don't know if they can catch the person who did this but it does bring awareness to these types of things.,2,13,99,29,0.912479397,2.009933639,2.230471304,
1099,17,Yeah that's a good point,1,13,72,28,0.290622162,1.695498097,1.555893745,

1105,7,Sounded like the person who wrote it was anti-hunting and took offense.  I am guessing they were culling the herd to protect farm animals or something.   Maybe it was attacking endangered species.,1,13,102,35,1.751113311,2.04259069,1.813229774,

1107,3,What was your first impression about the wolves article?,1,13,104,36,1.04067181,1.012438685,0.861316843,
1107,4,"Ugh. It kind of broke my heart to think about that young wolf working so hard to explore and try to find a pack/mate, only to be gunned down. :/ How about you?",2,13,105,37,2.133486001,3.898193955,3.8260988,
1107,5,"I understand. My first impression is that it will be difficult to prevent people from fighting back when they see a wolf hanging around. Although it's kind of sad, yes.",1,13,104,36,1.818460178,2.446128511,2.865170479,
1107,6,"Yeah, I can understand that they can be dangerous. I think they mostly attack livestock though, which I know farmers have a problem with too!",2,13,105,37,1.64384946,2.119331527,2.508396098,
1107,7,I guess it's normal to feel sorry for the wolf but it's hard to tell what's right in that situation since the first thing that comes to mind is that it's dangerous.,1,13,104,36,1.681759389,2.405128384,2.944050227,
1107,8,"One thought that comes to mind is that maybe there needs to be a better thought out/coordinated plan. For example I'm sure the org that raised/protected the wolves must have known they would wander hundreds of miles, and likely into other states, right?",2,13,105,37,1.286586014,1.961498249,2.644258891,
1107,9,If something is not well planned. They must take these situations into account and prevent them.,1,13,104,36,1.473726996,2.206541383,2.344997031,
1107,10,"Yes for sure. Like they could have coordinated in advance with the gov agencies in adjacent states to see if they would agree in advance to shoot the wolf with a tranquilizer gun instead or something, and transport it to a place like a wildnerness zone way up in the mountains or something.

1107,12,"Yes, for sure. I don't know about wolves and relocation, but whatever their plan was seems a bit shortsighted maybe. I know there was a similar story in California and a wolf traveled all the way down the cascades and then sierras, only to be hit by a car on the freeway in Southern California. Ugh.",2,13,105,37,1.975598804,2.898712802,3.000521762,

1107,14,"Yes, good idea. I had thought there are so few they are all monitored, but maybe not!",2,13,105,37,0.671850421,1.709115314,2.139758502,

1107,18,"Well I read an article once about the effect of no wolves on the environment in Yellowstone, and from what I understand the lack of wolves caused a proliferation of deer, which stripped the bark from the trees, which led to other consequences, and the whole biome kind of got out of whack.

1107,21,I'll take some time to watch those documentaries. It's good to know about those things.,1,13,104,36,0.2629649,2.108796012,2.037001337,

1107,24,"I think it would have babies and start its own pack, no? But that is also a bit sad because like the one who showed up in SoCal, he would have never run into any other wolves and would have wandered forever in search I think. Poor guy!",2,13,105,37,1.463221749,2.525576591,3.030190025,

1108,2,"Hi.  How did the article make you feel?  I felt sad for the victim and their family, but also confused about what motivated this murder.",2,14,60,38,1.705050596,2.754140353,2.184577099,
1108,3,I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.,1,14,69,39,1.923532748,2.948100233,3.055224419,
1108,4,"Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.",2,14,60,38,1.71916573,2.454790425,2.221412786,
1108,5,True. I also wonder how he was able to get a gun into the airport. Or perhaps it was in a public area? I think the article mentioned it was somewhat close to the employee parking.,1,14,69,39,1.430044341,2.010669255,2.192117512,
1108,6,"Yes, I think it was in the parking area, although I also think there are ways around airport security, unfortunately.  I thought the sadest thing was learning of the victim's children.  Obviously most 52-year-olds have children, but to have it explicitly stated makes it strike home that those adult children just lost their dad.",2,14,60,38,1.903423882,3.020603013,3.036666904,
1108,7,"Yeah, I couldn't imagine losing my father suddenly like this. It is cool that his children are athletes as well though. I'm sure he was really proud of their success.",1,14,69,39,1.365867698,3.017058253,3.363096748,
1108,8,"Yes, I'm sure.  And I'm sure they were proud of him.  But I imagine that makes the loss even harder.",2,14,60,38,1.630989631,3.100420165,3.210054551,
1108,9,Yeah. Do you think the airport handled this appropriately? Diverting almost all flights and stranding those inside the terminal for hours?,1,14,69,39,1.473913884,2.02213999,1.983365859,
1108,10,"It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.  But it's a good question.  I'm really not sure.  What are your feelings on the airport's response?",2,14,60,38,1.54256254,2.504014421,2.358869502,
1108,11,I think its better to be safe then sorry. I suppose they probably thought the gunman was running around the airport at first before they found him in the truck. I just wonder why it took so long. ,1,14,69,39,1.443741616,2.346798778,2.31598006,
1108,12,"Yeah, I'm not sure.  I know I'd be furious if I were in that situation and my flight was canceled.  To a large degree I think we punish the masses for the sake of the few far too often in this society.  But that's another issue.",2,14,60,38,1.950375573,2.936601305,2.422749911,
1108,13,"I would be too, especially if it was an important trip. I'd also agree with your point. I wonder why the police also received reports of a second victim. That probably contributed to things being shut down. ",1,14,69,39,1.784537705,2.485737038,2.469428267,
1108,14,"Yes, for sure.  I'm sure when things like this happen there are rumors flying all over the place.  People get information wrong, pass on information incorrectly, imagine things.  People aren't good witnesses.  So I'm sure in an instance like this--in all that chaos--there's all sorts of incorrect information or speculation and that uncertainty is one of the reasons why the whole airport can get shut down.",2,14,60,38,1.714510147,2.409689569,2.351628712,
1108,15,"Yeah I suppose when there are lots of people in one place like this, when things go down it would be a bit crazy. Information may come in, but it has to be verified by looking at the footage, searching the airport, etc. Do you think anything could have been done to prevent the attack, or was it just something no one could have anticipated?",1,14,69,39,1.472690288,2.215370321,2.26386737,
1108,16,"It's hard to say without more evidence of what actually motivated it.  I think the reality is that if one deranged person wants to kill you, there's not a lot you can do to stop it.  That's just life, and we shouldn't turn the world upside down to stop things we can't stop.",2,14,60,38,1.683222787,2.532125401,2.325673631,
1108,17,"Yeah, once again I wish there was some more information here. I would have really liked to know what happened between the two. I also want to know if the gunman previously had issues or anything. I also wonder if Michael knew the gunman was after him. I'd agree, we can't put so much security and limitations in place that it impacts our lives to a major degree. It would be a pain to live that way.",1,14,69,39,1.685972977,2.64551487,2.573183315,
1108,18,"Yes, it's a curious story.  I'd say that by definition the killer had issues to do this.  But again, it's totally unclear what precipitated this.",2,14,60,38,1.569822232,2.424833345,2.278900964,
1108,19,I do wonder if the gunman used to work with the victim. Without some serious stalking I'd say that's the only way he knew their schedule/routine.,1,14,69,39,1.316997671,1.96089325,2.270143628,
1108,20,"Yes, that's certainly possible.  It's amazing to think a workplace conflict could lead to murder, but something did.  I thought it was conspicous that no details were given about the identity of the killer.  That usually means they're black.",2,14,60,38,1.628350965,2.427096391,2.310911502,
1108,21,"I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.",1,14,69,39,1.802594105,2.560345125,2.298822335,
1108,22,"Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.  If you were one of the victim's family members, would you rather not know the motivation for your father's killing?  Or would you rather find out it was something bad, like he was having a homosexual affiar or something disgusting?",2,14,60,38,1.977804621,2.79800837,2.268931993,
1108,23,"Its hard to media that just sticks to the facts, and the stuff relevant to the story. Plus stuff that is truly unbiased. I'm really not sure what I'd want to learn. I wouldn't want to learn that my father was involved in anything bad, but would at least want to know some of the motivation behind the attack.",1,14,69,39,1.68335793,2.588628554,2.531935777,
1108,24,"Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.  They must have mixed, strange emotions.",2,14,60,38,1.906149069,2.775402093,3.006901537,
1108,25,"If I was the family of the murdered I would feel really ashamed, unless somehow they felt going after Michael was warranted somehow. I guess it all depends, without the information its hard to make a full judgement.",1,14,69,39,1.903371199,3.178252602,2.884050301,
1108,26,"Yeah, I wouldn't be happen with what he did.  But he's also dead.  They also lost a loved one.  That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.",2,14,60,38,1.701243552,2.639273214,2.644350852,
1108,27,Yeah. Well it looks like we are coming to our final messages. Its been good talking with you. I'm glad you feel the same way about the article.,1,14,69,39,0.541510039,1.989723969,1.291601015,
1108,28,"Yes, thanks for chatting.  It's been good.",2,14,60,38,0.152855407,1.703701735,1.107442745,
1108,29,"Yeah, thank you, so long.",1,14,69,39,0.488985238,1.363127744,0.872113258,
1108,30,Goodbye. Take care.  I hope you don't experience anything like this story.,2,14,60,38,0.681136982,2.147020578,1.218324849,
1109,1,"Hi, how are you?",1,14,67,40,0.538557184,1.067996812,0.680747288,
1109,2,"I'm well thanks, how about you?",2,14,102,41,0.368422443,1.459412742,0.822989464,
1109,3,"Doing good, thanks! So, what do you think about the article?",1,14,67,40,0.450123966,1.745025706,0.904416365,
1109,4,It was pretty sad.  It's unfortunate to lose a loved one in such a violent and unexpected way.,2,14,102,41,2.096171316,3.643099475,3.411380053,
1109,5,I feel the same way. I also feel saddened by the event. An attack on another human being shouldn't have happened in the first place,1,14,67,40,2.074222668,3.525137591,3.321251614,
1109,6,"Agreed.  What was solved, really?  What did the attacker get out of it?",2,14,102,41,1.733180777,2.510269356,2.305618244,
1109,7,"Revenge or to make themselves feel better. But that was not an excuse at all, they are evil! ",1,14,67,40,2.010469182,3.540745664,2.524705172,
1109,8,And whatever positive emotions they did feel didn't last long considering they committed suicide.,2,14,102,41,1.961198831,2.73478446,2.424721735,
1109,9,What's worse is the family who was left behind. I can't' imagine how I'd feel if I was them,1,14,67,40,2.112447182,3.737226391,3.665656601,
1109,10,Both families are probably wrecked.  ,2,14,102,41,2.071909952,3.496966338,3.386956675,
1109,11,Such a mess as well. Hundreds of people were stranded in the airport,1,14,67,40,2.029513264,3.005423355,2.629049786,
1109,12,Its too bad the attacker was so unhinged.  I wonder what caused it?,2,14,102,41,2.000978589,2.870255518,2.643878596,
1109,13,Do you think this was a real crime? Maybe can find that out online,1,14,67,40,1.088551764,1.402739298,1.015303399,
1109,14,"I suppose we can Google the victim's name.  It was in the story, Michael Winchester",2,14,102,41,1.084466314,1.416910005,1.236193431,
1109,15,Oh I think it's a true story,1,14,67,40,1.03566918,1.543211627,1.158322726,
1109,16,"Yeah, looks like it was revenge due to losing his job",2,14,102,41,1.747307515,1.876738906,1.776675761,
1109,17,"dang, that was such a stupid reason",1,14,67,40,2.006417807,3.103716969,1.93884417,
1109,18,"Yeah, it was just a job.  Find something else and move on.",2,14,102,41,1.649186977,2.446021366,1.974365873,
1109,19,"To be honest, in some way I am glad that the gunman died, but in another perspective, I think more effort should be put into mental health care and support",1,14,67,40,1.527804414,3.040758538,2.80916357,
1109,20,"For sure, this was something he could have dealt with constructively rather than what he chose",2,14,102,41,1.48454481,2.56925993,2.725599272,
1109,21,Maybe the company should provide some kind of help as well when they are firing people,1,14,67,40,1.145496702,2.063000894,2.354677371,
1109,22,He was terminated for drinking on the job.  Sounds like he was battling alcoholism.,2,14,102,41,1.701348209,2.045582306,2.107180808,
1109,23,oh I see. I didn't see that part. Thanks for the context. This guy had so many issues!,1,14,67,40,1.753067589,2.711579823,2.180829287,
1109,24,"Things just kept piling up in his mind, I suppose.",2,14,102,41,1.805529245,2.216250968,2.746861117,
1109,25,Killing other people and himself was probably his last resort... ,1,14,67,40,1.909359479,2.545284963,2.916965638,
1109,26,His only way out,2,14,102,41,1.717637046,2.35716083,2.441467319,
1109,27,Wish he could have gotten help and not ruin another person's life,1,14,67,40,1.798082685,3.07213912,3.398786919,
1109,28,"I wonder what his family thought before hand, how his mental state was?",2,14,102,41,1.255114889,2.160254884,3.147162318,
1109,29,Agree. I think we have similar reactions and feelings towards this incidents,1,14,67,40,1.25216647,2.207453346,2.671498299,
1109,30,"Yes I think so.  The world failed both people, our handling of mental health issues just isn't up to par.",2,14,102,41,1.974822998,3.1712605,3.022665858,
1110,1,Hello. did u  read the article?,1,14,61,43,1.115789239,1.161088556,0.734054152,
1110,2,"yes i did, it was pretty upsetting, what was your first reaction from it?",2,14,37,42,1.960753854,3.173068213,1.938621155,
1110,3,"I think it was such a tragedy, and I felt so bad for the victim the victims family and kind of a little bit angry as well because of the man who committed the crime it was unnecessary ",1,14,61,43,2.164422766,3.936852217,3.676658562,
1110,4,"It's horrible that someone would do something like this, especially at an airport where so many people are just trying to travel safely.",2,14,37,42,2.13638072,3.68515265,3.572766032,
1110,5,yes I totally agree. There were so many people probably affected by it that had to witness it as well.,1,14,61,43,2.021751134,3.107872272,3.302750622,
1110,6,What emotions did you get from it?,2,14,37,42,1.248326834,1.297172868,1.238824853,
1110,7,"sad and also, angry because of the man who committed the crime. What emotions did you get from it?",1,14,61,43,2.027684824,3.739249825,2.806573255,
1110,8,"I felt a mix of sadness, anger, and concern. Sadness for the victim and their family, anger towards the shooter for committing such a heinous act, and concern for the safety of everyone who was at the airport at the time of the shooting.",2,14,37,42,2.011617533,3.898255539,3.140032291,
1110,9," yes, I agree. That covers how I feel as well. ",1,14,61,43,1.446723262,2.420478201,2.246226643,
1110,10,"I also felt sympathy for Michael Winchester's family, especially his son who is a professional football player for the Kansas City Chiefs",2,14,37,42,1.683253137,2.651649165,3.225918106,
1110,11,"Yes, I saw that as well about his son plays for the Chiefs and his daughter is also a student athlete too",1,14,61,43,1.332136623,2.209981298,2.675679343,
1110,12,It just goes to show that these tragedies could happen to anyone at any time,2,14,37,42,1.959215728,2.604955578,2.680552483,
1110,13, yes that's the truth. It's awful and scary to think that it could happen to anybody anywhere.,1,14,61,43,2.082923778,3.71699326,2.97992209,
1110,14,I know!,2,14,37,42,1.753123911,2.81241045,1.716204805,
1110,15,I'm curious and wondering how the guy got past airport security with a gun? ,1,14,61,43,1.250191935,1.907774329,1.674704688,
1110,16,"That is a good question, I guess someone dropped the ball",2,14,37,42,1.774630499,1.912870157,1.669089104,
1110,17,"Yeah, that's for sure! It never mentioned it in the article that I saw. Did you see anything about how the guy got past them with a gun? ",1,14,61,43,1.511096867,2.110399342,1.637310258,
1110,18,"I did not see any info about that, do you have any guesses as to how that could have happened?",2,14,37,42,1.164588094,1.365818405,1.158463968,
1110,19,I don't know either I can't think of a possible way I remember the article said that he kind of stalked the guy (premeditated) I don't remember the exact wording though,1,14,61,43,1.567497683,1.752731991,1.923043166,
1110,20,It's heart-wrenching to think about how much pain they must be going through right now,2,14,37,42,2.105558634,3.521184015,3.702490687,
1110,21,"I could not even imagine what it must be like to be them. That is just awful. I couldn't begin to comprehend, what it must be like.",1,14,61,43,2.124906778,4.274296474,3.770934922,
1110,22,the article left me feeling deeply saddened and concerned about the safety of public spaces,2,14,37,42,2.137943411,3.835573149,3.203124353,
1110,23,"I think it is sad, and I think the news should report good things that happen as much as they do report the bad things that happen",1,14,61,43,2.032543659,2.970357609,2.780678528,
1110,24,unfrotunately good news is not very popular and new companies are in the business of getting views,2,14,37,42,1.819176571,2.080650413,1.879850396,
1110,25," yep. In the business of getting views and making dollars. If they would refocus their way of thinking and try to focus on positive things, I think there's a lot of people out there that would be more attracted to watching the news.",1,14,61,43,0.87894694,2.18980813,2.066894548,
1110,26,"I agree, it could be worth a shot, I think there is a symbiotic relationship between media and the viewers, one could change the other",2,14,37,42,0.424700578,2.002440512,1.991724832,
1110,27,"Yes, for sure. I totally agree with you. I think unfortunately negativities spreads quicker than good things and I don't know why that is",1,14,61,43,1.33273011,2.21490885,2.142340234,

1144,2,Hello,2,16,111,72,1.086724516,0.953361225,0.711454613,
1144,3,what was your first reaction of the article,1,16,61,73,1.143615723,1.106319261,0.815405739,
1144,4,"made me feel very scared, how did you feel after you read the article",2,16,111,72,2.059527445,3.730716038,2.049694121,
1144,5, I'm sorry that it made you feel scared. I sympathize with you. ,1,16,61,73,1.977116458,3.349103069,2.164509084,
1144,6,How did it make you feel,2,16,111,72,1.215702637,1.192305303,0.999098778,
1144,7,I felt bad for the people that live there. That's my first thought. I feel really bad for the people that live there and probably can't do anything about it to leave because it sounds like a real crappy place in my opinion,1,16,61,73,2.137499015,3.561382508,3.249140978,
1144,8,I don't really understand what the war is about do you?,2,16,111,72,1.351587653,1.514064169,1.290318344,
1144,9, from my understanding there were rebels that were given an ultimatum to lay down their arms and if not they were going to be killed it also said the article was from CNN so I don't take too much stock and anything that comes from there ,1,16,61,73,1.726005602,1.633491373,1.683297966,
1144,10,I read that to but that's not what the war is about.  I would like to find out. ,2,16,111,72,1.348768298,1.59844116,1.411305274,
1144,11,It doesn't say specifically but it mentions some things like when it referred to how Russia is there a major player with the president and government over there and how syria is trying to gain control over the city but I I don't understand completely myself honestly ,1,16,61,73,1.41344858,1.64290756,1.838107663,
1144,12,Either way I cannot not imagine having to live like that how about you,2,16,111,72,1.861029291,2.159951925,2.425242696,
1144,13, I could not imagine living like that. I am very thankful to be an American and living in the United States. There is absolutely no way I would ever want to live in Syria with that type of stuff going on that's for sure. The article also talked about Isis and some things about the Kurds they talked about a lot of the groups over there  ,1,16,61,73,1.825743326,2.907256866,2.376687987,

1144,15,yes i agree. After I had sent that last message I started thinking maybe that is one of the reasons that it is going on over there  because it says something about Isis and having a strong hold over a city over there ,1,16,61,73,1.546962794,2.087527764,1.571458093,

1144,25,oh wow! Tell me more about that lol where did they go to meet and stuff? How did they meet like for the first time? lol,1,16,61,73,0.622101098,2.188002229,1.5047396,
1144,26,If I remember right they went to Bali or something because syria is considered a terrorist country they are not allowed in many countries or something,2,16,111,72,1.367888705,1.628514612,1.6338166,
1144,27, yes Syria is considered a terrorist country. They are involved and a lot of terrorist groups come out of Syria. But this 90 day fianc¨¦ show sounds rather interesting lol what is it a whole season based on this I don't know why this just grabbed my attention but it sounds really interesting. Sounds complicated too lol,1,16,61,73,1.169402806,2.281495404,1.797997372,
1144,28,"lol, yes. It's reality tv so they have a season on how they meet, then if they get serious the apply for a visa to get married and have 90 days to do it.  It fun and crazy all at the same time.  ",2,16,111,72,0.646084871,2.176873696,1.749714051,
1144,29,lol that sounds pretty cool pretty interesting to watch lol I never watched it myself and I never really should have judged it as a reality show and not being interesting or some thing I guess because I never gave it a chance if that makes sense ,1,16,61,73,0.456672744,2.226141858,1.77633558,
1144,30,But reading that article made me recall that season and part of their dilema was where they would live.  She couldn't go to syria as they would kill her but he had to go to finish like his schooling or something.,2,16,111,72,1.218906943,1.842545068,1.902492906,
1145,1,Hello,1,16,112,70,1.044943575,0.767611629,0.672438675,
1145,2,hello,2,16,113,71,1.026810841,0.901717502,0.69091131,
1145,3,what did you think of the article?,1,16,112,70,1.03643107,0.823982561,0.693946046,
1145,4,it made me sad,2,16,113,71,2.142885804,3.321538043,2.956187725,
1145,5,It was quite distressing to read for me. I am not a fan of war,1,16,112,70,2.162805192,3.671596599,3.419395464,
1145,6,i think Syria is being unfairly attacked,2,16,113,71,2.088789765,2.512869954,2.515921201,
1145,7,I agree. Many innocent people are getting harmed.,1,16,112,70,2.075997527,2.465662432,3.023792897,
1145,8,the food shortages were alarming,2,16,113,71,2.095144987,2.784590888,2.408498653,
1145,9,What did you think about the warning message sent to residents of Aleppo? How did it make you feel?,1,16,112,70,1.254758684,1.204678696,1.467881782,
1145,10,"that would be a shocking warning message to receive, it made me feel alarmed and shocked",2,16,113,71,2.113121327,3.879010105,3.054756216,
1145,11,Yes me too.,1,16,112,70,1.749039086,2.107759094,1.899254254,
1145,12,i think the amount of people being killed in Syria is being censored,2,16,113,71,1.964360412,2.046127963,1.984361138,
1145,13,"Probably to keep others from panicking. The article mentions the lack of aid and supplies in Aleppo. Do you think more can be done to help the civilians affected by the conflict? If so, what do you think should be done?",1,16,112,70,1.548008394,1.951765203,2.172663867,
1145,14,"Yes, the Turkish government and other entities such as the USA proxy armies should stop attacking Syria",2,16,113,71,1.644691181,2.04198271,2.018474528,
1145,15,I agree. The USA seems to have their nose in everyone's business.,1,16,112,70,1.915173205,2.145891547,1.673834418,
1145,16,USA has a global war machine,2,16,113,71,1.906387822,1.957000625,1.247617189,
1145,17,What do you think needs to happen for the conflict in Aleppo to come to an end and for the people there to begin to rebuild their lives?,1,16,112,70,1.137894543,1.423128927,1.384249117,
1145,18,it would be good for Turkey and USA and others to stop funding the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other entities that are attacking the innocent Syrian people,2,16,113,71,1.458595292,2.020814991,1.996414483,
1145,19,I think so as well. Now when do we get this code. It has been more than 15 respones,1,16,112,70,1.21006821,1.737129676,1.246105743,
1145,20,"we have to do 15 responses each, i think it is interesting that countries have these battles with each other but they all have a treaty together for Antarctica",2,16,113,71,1.158137695,1.770605135,1.174563987,
1145,21,"Yes, Antarctica seems to have a lot of attention from people and yet we still don't know all about it. ",1,16,112,70,1.089929334,1.563167691,1.255605276,
1145,22,i recently read about the Flat Earth Theory saying that Antarctica is an ice wall ,2,16,113,71,1.301114504,1.472532606,1.157234043,
1145,23,I'll have to read into that. The article mentions that the Syrian government is accusing rebels of using civilians as human shields. What do you think about this accusation? Do you think it is a valid argument or an excuse to justify attacks on civilian areas?,1,16,112,70,1.314884543,1.615512192,1.369412584,
1145,24,"it is probably an excuse to justify attacks on civilian areas, i think Syria is telling the truth and the opposition is lying",2,16,113,71,1.825241844,1.840913963,1.503501032,
1145,25,It also mentioned that the UN warned that eastern Aleppo was on the brink of starvation. Do you think that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in situations like this to prevent mass suffering?,1,16,112,70,1.47708141,1.884749305,1.703358497,
1145,26,"the ""international community"" seems to want to starve Syria perhaps because Syria is not willing to use the same monetary system as other countries?",2,16,113,71,1.937764208,1.94771769,1.520355412,
1145,27,That is an interesting way to think about it. ,1,16,112,70,0.952501869,1.515132451,1.194555466,
1145,28,the United Nations and other entities want globalism with a one-world currency and one-world religion for maximum control,2,16,113,71,1.845922971,1.966023219,1.425229754,
1145,29,So true. Sorry i'm running out of questions to ask,1,16,112,70,1.549169795,1.613637793,1.066784301,
1145,30,what do you think is the proper future number for the global human population?,2,16,113,71,1.046144549,1.120749885,0.768199252,
1150,1,"Hello, hope you are well",1,16,119,75,0.379634847,1.519159806,0.776281906,
1150,2,Hello,2,16,72,74,0.79375153,1.249366045,0.797455255,
1150,3,Honestly I found the article overall sad especially with them having to abandon the area in 24 hours,1,16,119,75,2.103065101,3.546949744,3.557240384,
1150,4,So did I. Very tragic,2,16,72,74,2.118144011,3.632113862,3.562966841,
1150,5,If only something could be done,1,16,119,75,1.501456404,3.032462692,3.321260367,
1150,6,I think the article was quite dated though,2,16,72,74,1.405908163,1.402870595,1.558019102,
1150,7,Really? I was reading though the entire article and I was so focused that I could not find the date,1,16,119,75,1.217358589,1.763217723,1.645151939,
1150,8,"I seem to recall this happened a while back. Nevertheless, very sad to read",2,16,72,74,2.039965137,2.960202193,2.788518139,
1150,9,"Yep, especially the idea of them potentially starving too",1,16,119,75,2.078063345,2.926075768,3.417623707,
1150,10,"Yes, it's hard to imagine going through that",2,16,72,74,2.036991692,3.070554757,3.364957316,
1150,11,A lot of people hopefully never have to go though an experience like that,1,16,119,75,1.196371945,2.771828961,3.222485696,
1150,12,It shows the risks of a fragmented society,2,16,72,74,1.896793373,1.997683084,2.35807332,
1150,13,Definitely but then you stop and think. Why is Russia getting involved in this Syrian Civil war? ,1,16,119,75,1.564422639,1.77903744,1.826732482,
1150,14,And why is Turkey?,2,16,72,74,1.233633343,1.177050197,1.05599036,
1150,15,"Exactly, what does Turkey have to do with this as well",1,16,119,75,1.367775639,1.365756679,1.357969637,
1150,16,Great power rivalry I suppose,2,16,72,74,1.400489799,1.386855781,1.36359867,
1150,17,"I suppose so, but overall nothing we can do as much we would like to",1,16,119,75,1.504463061,1.860662019,1.865245019,
1150,18,"I agree, I wish we could",2,16,72,74,1.039928218,2.418401504,1.975944434,
1150,19,It further shows you the tragedy of war and why people should not be rooting for it,1,16,119,75,1.90990901,2.834646821,2.882661326,
1150,20,What can we do though?,2,16,72,74,0.984611209,1.28546927,1.318112246,
1150,21,Probably tell our US government that first of all war should never be celebrated,1,16,119,75,1.177568237,2.206739092,2.201876368,
1150,22,DO they listen?,2,16,72,74,1.220064251,1.449686337,1.144235347,
1150,23,"Of course not, see what they are doing with Ukraine. There is no peace yet, and it just enriches the biggest weapon manufacturers.",1,16,119,75,2.008765531,2.494970059,2.142894685,
1150,24,I agree,2,16,72,74,1.052948002,1.482163835,1.390961758,
1150,25,"Even though I see the war between Russia and Ukraine, as something Russia started. Sending more weapons definitely should be off the table",1,16,119,75,1.699770681,2.262100029,2.203464551,
1150,26,It's important to vote,2,16,72,74,0.828581798,1.649514663,1.524003966,
1150,27,"It's, not like either party cares honestly",1,16,119,75,1.912674538,2.136968946,1.591741102,
1150,28,"Likely true, sadly",2,16,72,74,1.807388902,2.085312974,1.564897418,
1150,29,"Then again going back to the topic on hand, we would see if the war in Syria eventually ends",1,16,119,75,1.026568973,1.695615745,1.901609021,
1150,30,I hope it does soon,2,16,72,74,0.294115253,2.186987412,1.87953335,
1163,1,Hello,1,17,130,77,0.992526527,0.828380156,0.692361576,
1163,2,Hi,2,17,131,76,0.938407004,0.917145151,0.716294063,
1163,3,So what did you think about the article?,1,17,130,77,0.988784858,0.966360617,0.723601697,
1163,4,I thought it was rather depressing but honest. How about you?,2,17,131,76,1.981563004,3.029985189,2.64454031,
1163,5,Same. It's horrible what those people are going through. I wish something could be done.,1,17,130,77,2.134212144,3.6683074,3.919635994,
1163,6,I feely you...when I read things like that I feel so helpless,2,17,131,76,2.124211788,3.520337987,3.680888074,
1163,7,"Yeah, no amount of human suffering is worth a war.",1,17,130,77,2.063755933,2.951459289,3.092791915,
1163,8,"It all seems so futile, especially since the average family is the one who suffers the most, not the actual fighters.",2,17,131,76,2.123573097,2.980872369,3.349144152,
1163,9,"Yep, the citizens are the ones who are displaced and end up starving to death.",1,17,130,77,2.058300924,2.454073298,3.175176178,
1163,10,I can't help but think what would happen to my grandmother and family if there was a war like this in the US,2,17,131,76,2.015989868,3.122040248,3.551216108,
1163,11,I think about the same thing. It's one of the reasons I fear a global conflict.,1,17,130,77,2.040640783,2.811858678,2.897747108,
1163,12,It could just as easily happen anywhere. It is scary and again makes me feel helpless.,2,17,131,76,2.091483124,3.401237106,3.073231408,
1163,13,Yep. I just wish all sides would just calm down and work things out diplomatically.,1,17,130,77,1.495688955,2.882276487,2.662237849,
1163,14,Yeah but the Good Ole Boys Club will never let that happen.,2,17,131,76,1.939153854,2.21844635,1.971669563,
1163,15,"Nope, there is just too much money to be made from weapons and defense contracts.",1,17,130,77,1.817084042,2.115375614,1.986604367,
1163,16,Exactly. The people at the root don't have to deal with the problems mentioned in the article,2,17,131,76,1.764608343,2.053166711,2.158085218,
1163,17,"No, they don't deal with the problem, but sadly they're usually the ones creating it.",1,17,130,77,1.894086687,2.450672174,2.27470977,
1163,18,Yes that's exactly what I mean. They make decisions that create major trickle down life and death scenarios constantly,2,17,131,76,1.896956428,2.583555627,2.441622938,
1163,19,"People need to start voting for better leaders. Assuming they're a democracy, anyway.",1,17,130,77,1.068738957,2.294603515,2.147271054,
1163,20,In an ideal world that would help.,2,17,131,76,0.370986523,2.289235449,1.842520731,
1163,21,Yep. I wish more places would embrace the democratic process -- then a lot of this could be prevented.,1,17,130,77,0.630778746,2.454707551,2.290807707,
1163,22,Yes but even democratic countries go to war and are capable of causing this kind of suffering,2,17,131,76,1.959187746,2.382905054,2.281934874,
1163,23,"Yeah, I guess democracy doesn't do a lot of good if the country is filled with warmongering voters.",1,17,130,77,1.946894169,2.2524786,2.120034916,
1163,24,Well said. I thought the point about the hospitals not being able to handle the chronic health issues of the elderly was an interesting and sad point as well,2,17,131,76,1.77340951,2.479545641,2.876663498,
1163,25,"Yeah, they are too busy tending to battlefield wounds. It's sad. The man who lives with his ten children and grandchildren really stuck with me. I can't imagine living in fear of an airstrike on your house at any given moment.",1,17,130,77,2.073814511,3.268803954,3.402317813,
1163,26,Right? It would be so exhausting and frustrating to live like that.,2,17,131,76,2.041245468,3.135018921,3.361803276,
1163,27,It makes me grateful for what I have and where I live.,1,17,130,77,0.271143784,3.183423972,3.054701805,
1163,28,No kidding. I don't think I'd be able to handle that kind of life.,2,17,131,76,1.883058151,3.303755212,3.264691285,
1163,29,Nope. Those people are a lot stronger than I am.,1,17,130,77,0.785466395,3.059961557,3.119296449,
1163,30,I found myself wondering how they get through the day.,2,17,131,76,1.427621241,2.978865457,3.079370924,
1164,1,"Hello, what did you think about the article?",1,17,132,79,0.963623877,0.806021869,0.729167161,

1164,5,I agree. There are so many wars going on around the world. I also wonder how I can help.,1,17,132,79,1.909596181,2.362429643,2.779579112,
1164,6,The USA likes waging many wars,2,17,113,78,1.946901806,1.844804752,1.63074444,

1170,1,Hello?,1,17,135,81,0.924669305,0.782474923,0.731937193,
1170,2,Hi there!,2,17,136,80,0.707638601,1.090520167,0.769800186,
1170,3,"Hi! So, how did you feel about the article?",1,17,135,81,0.892830821,1.184433055,0.824664184,
1170,4,It left me a bit depressed and sad. How about you?,2,17,136,80,2.120935631,3.54232564,3.497525896,
1170,5,Me too... I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to spend the final years of your life in a country with so much war.,1,17,135,81,2.132637246,3.355334806,3.902490752,

1170,7,"Me too. It's hard to imagine, but at the same time, I know it's real for some people...",1,17,135,81,1.931009563,2.599811578,3.451423679,
1170,8,"Definitely, it made me think about the circumstances under which I would even consider leaving my parents. Maybe if I had young kids or something, but I cannot get my head around it.",2,17,136,80,1.799110111,3.032743931,3.448273216,
1170,9,Agreed. I don't think I could ever rest easily knowing that my parents lives are at risk like that.,1,17,135,81,1.989098072,2.893555045,3.539642709,
1170,10,I guess the article also made me angry at how civilians get caught up in armed conflicts and are used by both/all sides.,2,17,136,80,2.06039993,3.169307661,3.172495995,
1170,11,"I can agree with that. In war, it seems like civilians are seen simply as numbers, rather than human beings living real lives.

1170,13,I wonder if there's another way. Does one really have to kill innocent people in order to make a point?,1,17,135,81,1.648703194,2.635049152,2.696166328,
1170,14,Society would have to change a lot for us to get to that point but it does seem like there have to be better ways.,2,17,136,80,1.158191093,2.202464199,2.529488495,
1170,15,"Yeah, it would take a lot of effort on both sides in order to get to that point, but I hope that some day, innocent people don't have to lose their lives over a fight they're not involved in...",1,17,135,81,1.133421747,2.548825121,2.865466101,
1170,16,"In the article, I was curious that the one person remaining in Aleppo in the home he built had 10 children living with him. If he's that elderly, I thought they would be in their 40s or 50s which was odd.",2,17,136,80,1.229725186,2.075307059,2.56859323,

1170,18,"That's what I was thinking, but just curious about it. I need to do some more specific research about Syria itself and the conflict there too.",2,17,136,80,0.99345719,1.579297054,2.088484747,
1170,19,"Yeah, hearing about it, it almost feels like they're living in an entirely different world. I wonder if it's standard for children to stay in the home for that long?",1,17,135,81,1.157472261,2.096365845,2.81683273,
1170,20,"I suspect in other cultures. I lived in a developing country and it was so different from the U.S., multiple generations in one home or next to each other. Grandparents took care of little kids while parents worked. People took care of grandparents, etc., no retirement, government assistance.",2,17,136,80,0.989057676,2.190038884,2.474614722,
1170,21,"Oh, did you? That's interesting. It seems like other countries are more collectivist - more oriented toward taking care of the family than toward individual success.",1,17,135,81,0.755046219,1.989927566,2.138515379,

1170,23,"Lol, I would imagine that my parents would be the same, yes. Then again, it sounds like you're speaking about a situation in which families are nearly forced to live together, since there's no retirement or anything. Grandparents would be forced to live with their kids and be taken care of by them, or they wouldn't be able to pay for food or shelter.",1,17,135,81,1.101008085,2.396712518,2.804333721,
1170,24,Right...although I imagine my parents would probably push me to leave with kids if the situation were like Aleppo even if I didn't want to do it.,2,17,136,80,1.264072386,2.255262351,2.714652692,

1170,26,I was thinking more in terms of frailty and health conditions but if the guy in the story could leave with the family....that size seems like they could manage assisting a couple of elderly folks.,2,17,136,80,0.934018425,2.114055669,2.86421723,

1170,29,"Yeah... It seems that way. I wish I could show these people a better life somehow. It's so sad that people are forced to live their only life in the midst of a warzone. I know it's improbable, but I still wish I could.",1,17,135,81,1.927089477,3.043375158,3.430159807,
1170,30,"Same, it makes me wonder how many people live in these active conflict zone and then others are in refugee camps, etc., and basically can't leave.",2,17,136,80,1.824695881,2.129043007,3.087670054,
1171,1,Whatd you think of the article?,1,18,137,89,0.897452442,0.667887281,0.648015067,
1171,2,I thought it was interesting but I was curious to know how the polar bears' populations have changed during the time discussed.,2,18,60,88,0.870064644,1.752716708,2.110981831,
1171,3,"I agree, there wasn't much information given in that area",1,18,137,89,1.123308369,1.405721688,1.776579116,
1171,4,I'm also curious to see how polar bears adapt to their changing conditions.  Life doesn't usually just roll over and die.  It adapts and finds a way.  I'm curious how their behavior is changing.,2,18,60,88,0.822059222,2.118867373,2.930583784,
1171,5,It is tough without the population data because they could be handling very well,1,18,137,89,1.084882486,1.858520305,2.270057559,
1171,6,"Yes, I suppose.  I'm not sure that's likely, but it's possible. They're big, impressive creatures.  But even they're weak compared to nature.",2,18,60,88,1.132731152,1.898149586,2.437865666,
1171,7,"I read more into the article being that of a expected time shift, something that happens every so often to the Earth",1,18,137,89,0.912393159,1.628123343,1.952828807,
1171,8,"It's true that lots of things about earth change over time.  We tend to think of what we know of earth as how it's SUPPOSED to be.

1171,10,"Yes, it's a very difficult problem to solve.  Does the thought of polar bears dying out make you sad, or does it make you happy because it means fewer seals are being eaten by polar bears?",2,18,60,88,1.502382525,2.260875297,2.89594623,
1171,11,Definitely sad since that means that others can't experience also,1,18,137,89,1.901812919,2.873521185,3.408920016,
1171,12,Polar bears are a unique and impressive species.  Have you ever seen one in person?  I've seen them at the Denver Zoo.,2,18,60,88,0.439072216,2.245274162,2.759164129,
1171,13,Yeah I've seen one at the Cincinnati Zoo. Couldn't imagine not having polar bears around,1,18,137,89,0.858121945,2.317297482,2.580184272,
1171,14,Do you think they'll adapt to their changing conditions?,2,18,60,88,0.919924279,1.090155292,1.502936951,
1171,15,If the season is just shifting yes. Whats your viewpoint,1,18,137,89,0.966981192,1.392551827,1.620908047,
1171,16,"I think their behavior will definitely change.  If the ice patterns, which dictate their hunting behavior, change, they will migrate or do something to just to adapt.  That might involve infringing on human territory more often.  And at that point who knows what happens to them.  Because while polar bears are impressive, humans won't put up with them invading their spaces for too long.",2,18,60,88,1.643356554,2.087942135,2.743208459,

1171,18,"It's way too complex a problem to suggest one simple solution.  I personally think that concerns for the polar bears should come way, way down on a list of priorities.  What do you think?",2,18,60,88,1.629429142,2.379666114,2.179574021,
1171,19,Im not sure. Do you think this seasonal shift could snowball into a large problem?,1,18,137,89,1.387746763,1.616025484,1.614260529,
1171,20,"A large problem for whom?  I think this could certainly spell trouble for polar bears.  And that will have some effect on seal populations, and possibly human settlements in and around the arctic.

1171,21,It is possible that polar bears population increase after a decrease,1,18,137,89,0.845570501,1.685218775,1.87241544,
1171,22,"Sure, that's possible.  Lots of things are possible.  I think in the short term, however, the polar bear populations will likely be decreasing, and something about the situation will have to change for the populations to start increasing.",2,18,60,88,1.242698193,1.824051762,2.083762833,
1171,23,The shift is strange though. What were your first thoughts on the article,1,18,137,89,1.094368895,1.561803007,1.529924452,
1171,24,"I just found it interesting and I was curious about learning more about the effects the seasonal shifts are having.  Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?  Because I believe male polar bears will cannibalize other bears.",2,18,60,88,1.003168098,1.77573036,2.336060958,
1171,25,Its definitely possible. I think that they could just be eating less also.,1,18,137,89,0.996750168,1.615652454,2.098751179,
1171,26,"Yes, that's possible.  And I wonder how that changes their behavior, too.  For example, are they hibernating for shorter periods of time?  And how does all this affect pregnancies?  Lots of interesting questions.  It's like a labratory for studying how life adapts and changes in the face of changing environmental conditions.",2,18,60,88,0.672098056,2.13160485,2.531203491,
1171,27,The behavior part is interesting. I imagine they may be more resourceful and skilled,1,18,137,89,0.390983234,1.92944144,2.362119777,

1173,2,Hello. Yes I did. What were the emotions that you took from it and what was your first reaction regarding it?,2,18,61,91,1.132627686,1.609056139,1.31598565,
1173,3,"It was heartbreaking to hear that they are loosing the ability to survive. my first reaction was, If people need proof that global warming is happing, then read this article",1,18,107,90,2.106735229,3.37788856,3.470968161,
1173,4," That's what I was going to ask you, what you thought the article was more geared towards. I couldn't tell if it was kind of both or was referring mostly to climate change or the polar bears",2,18,61,91,1.260667769,1.835134792,1.808020234,
1173,5,"Thats what i took from it, was about how global warming is causing the polar bears across the artic to have shorter winters etc. with them loosing about 7 weeks each year or so for the past 35 years. its about a 25% loss over the 35 years of study they done",1,18,107,90,1.667888951,1.822356796,2.449671609,
1173,6, yeah 25% as a whole bunch in my opinion. That would mean in 140 years or less but it'll be gone? Am I doing the math correctly?,2,18,61,91,1.661702236,2.044242036,2.160224233,
1173,7,I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. ,1,18,107,90,1.762412715,2.135152066,2.569395355,
1173,8,that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?,2,18,61,91,2.113395953,3.204946184,3.30174177,
1173,9,"thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.  Sad reality is, people are too selfish. so more then likely they will all die out. besides the ones in captivity and the ones who live in Alaska etc. ",1,18,107,90,1.926162457,2.537610722,2.827796425,
1173,10," Yes I was wondering if they were still on the endangered species list as well. I need to brush up on my geography that's for sure because I don't even know what is near there. I would have to Google it, it's been a long time ",2,18,61,91,1.317389774,1.988736582,2.121930906,
1173,11,I think what they were referring to was Antarctica. I think there are some small towns and such there. Inuit's mostly probably (guessing)  but as far as countries and what not. i think Africa is close?  Same for me. i need to brush up on locations etc. i know the general area lol.,1,18,107,90,1.02813892,1.751506829,1.821702855,
1173,12, Same here lol I know the area but it's been so long since I was in school but I guess I should be more aware of things like this. But surely since the study was done that they can come up with a plan or are working on one to help the polar bears there's something awful like that does happen or continues to happen I should say,2,18,61,91,0.965068595,2.093428445,2.329743351,
1173,13,yeah totally. More then likely they just want to leave them alone and just store data. but as it dwindles down to the last few they will start protecting them in reserves and such im guessing as well lol,1,18,107,90,0.831787181,2.014387548,2.321791538,
1173,14, I hope they wouldn't let them like starve to death or watch them die or something.. somebody's gotta do something about that.,2,18,61,91,1.481564061,2.884881878,2.810209206,
1173,15,maybe they will start air dropping food in or something in remote locations where the tribes of the polar bears are. Might just scare them away though,1,18,107,90,1.170644204,2.051618302,2.311750412,
1173,16,Hey that's a really good idea airdropping food! Holy smokes that's like really incredible idea good  thinking!! I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food ,2,18,61,91,0.488282756,2.672528219,2.186759847,
1173,17,"another downside i was thinking was if they did air drop food in, im wondering if they would just become reliant on that and tend to stay in the area where it was dropped expecting more to come etc. Thus causing them to not hunt at all. (could be a longshot of a thought) lol ",1,18,107,90,1.248027945,2.273528278,2.0221099,
1173,18,"(i typed ""I see your point too about it might scare away"" my auto correct changed my word to the word ""doubt"" lol sorry) that's a another great point that you bring up about them becoming reliant and staying in the area.

1173,19,"Yeah i agree.  With their 35 years of data they have, they should be able to think of something. lol..... On a side note. i think we still have a few more rounds of this to go before we submit lol",1,18,107,90,0.633704708,2.016244721,1.849012426,
1173,20,lol yes im at 9 right now i think... So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do? ,2,18,61,91,0.839241485,1.840551758,1.507419297,
1173,21,I think its 30 total for both of us combined. which means 9 more after this message if thats the case.  If i were in charge? Hard to say without knowing all of the other data that they have found. We were only presented with a small amount for purposes of the article. I would say try to observe first then interact where you can. Overall you want them to still be in their own environment and such,1,18,107,90,0.916210794,1.828054202,1.773601472,
1173,22,yes its 30 combined 15 each... Yes we were presented with a small amount of info from the article I probably asked a crazy question lol I was just brainstorming on the idea you had because I thought it was really good about dropping in the food that was really good ,2,18,61,91,0.684873333,1.956574893,1.794325897,
1173,23,"yeah i think that might be the best. dropping some sort of food via air drop. wither it be live game they can ""hunt"" still themselves. or some sort of food already cut up for them. some way that can still give them a sense of they are doing it on their own lol",1,18,107,90,0.481163156,1.98143785,2.245067775,
1173,24,Live game that's pretty good right there too. That way they don't become human dependent and don't forget to learn how to hunt ,2,18,61,91,0.356152418,1.97701844,2.170384152,

1173,26,yes I agree. What is that called when animals that are wild become dependent on humans it's not like being team but there's another name for it and I cannot think of what it's called it's right on the tip of my tongue ,2,18,61,91,0.999461106,1.976244175,1.787266816,

1179,8,yeah me too I think that we are solely responsible ,2,18,65,92,2.029490368,2.603104615,2.123556256,

1179,26,thats true. what was your first reaction while reading the article?,2,18,65,92,1.136002441,1.816858888,1.821781337,

1179,30,yeah I have been following the climate change quite closely  ,2,18,65,92,1.404404966,1.879962552,2.178851502,
1183,1,"hello, my first reaction to the article was to feel angry",1,19,143,95,2.00143648,3.35618422,2.942971553,
1183,2,yeah me too,2,19,49,94,1.799516177,2.07940551,2.612813388,
1183,3,I don't like hearing about abuse happening to children,1,19,143,95,2.106380312,2.97543366,3.397781304,
1183,4,he had a rough life,2,19,49,94,2.091879034,2.365034246,3.25404942,

1183,6,why those assholes adopted him i don't know,2,19,49,94,1.920967031,2.529155231,2.43612068,
1183,7,or how an adoption agency let people like that adopt him,1,19,143,95,1.935356855,2.502675271,2.452532896,
1183,8,yes exactly,2,19,49,94,1.574156173,1.655443466,1.86528985,
1183,9,seems like there are problems with adoption in this country because it happened twice,1,19,143,95,1.99419655,1.706684566,2.156237219,
1183,10,i don't get how he still wasn't a citizen,2,19,49,94,1.838761751,1.762240624,2.445893628,
1183,11,"adoption should be to provide a better life, not abuse",1,19,143,95,1.618761933,2.573444319,2.706828288,
1183,12,i wonder what happened to the parents,2,19,49,94,1.218891279,1.698029196,2.386855704,
1183,13,i wondered too. I didn't know that being adopted by us citizens didn't automatically make you a citizen,1,19,143,95,1.403628985,1.820545459,2.389696922,
1183,14,that makes no sense,2,19,49,94,1.964613096,2.531857109,2.186621393,

1183,16,and what about his kids,2,19,49,94,1.858976595,2.218863142,3.012417776,
1183,17,"exactly, poor kids will lose their dad",1,19,143,95,2.050542426,2.735066533,3.364605682,
1183,18,are they citizens?,2,19,49,94,1.139592234,1.231521535,1.640054567,

1183,20,i just hope they fix it and get him back,2,19,49,94,0.506869137,2.405287719,3.275805354,

1183,22,hopefully the articles brings awareness,2,19,49,94,0.234252396,1.872031152,2.503905824,
1183,23,maybe a movement will be started to pass some new adoption laws,1,19,143,95,0.392425985,1.84796406,2.494975056,
1183,24,yes and politicians that care,2,19,49,94,0.428711451,1.85290072,2.412270818,
1183,25,yes if we could find some that would be nice,1,19,143,95,0.283475818,2.03219167,2.293422988,
1183,26,"i wonder if south korea would consider him a ""citizen""",2,19,49,94,0.895669587,1.401711476,2.204208391,

1184,3,It's bad and unfair,1,19,144,97,2.113476713,3.155467105,2.968356201,
1184,4,I agree. Sometimes I think we do things like that because we want to feel that we are better than others.,2,19,145,96,1.86667641,2.482202721,2.998536161,
1184,5,"It was most perplexing that they didn't even sign the boy up for his citizenship, as if they already knew that they wanted to mistreat him.",1,19,144,97,2.024596445,3.218192196,3.328662344,
1184,6,"Yes, I felt that that was a part of the abuse. I have a problem dealing with the abuse of children.  I have seen the results.",2,19,145,96,2.057252645,3.388237524,3.362770268,

1184,9,I got a lot of respect for the adopted parents that treat their kids well.,1,19,144,97,0.205702025,2.618397498,2.821332318,
1184,10,Yes. One of my nephews has 2 adopted and two of their own. They would correct me at once and tell me they have 4 kids.,2,19,145,96,0.466753773,2.313287711,2.236328517,

1184,13,"They are people to be proud of :D I hope that the man in the story can come back over and be with his family - if the story is real. Sometimes they use fake stories, but it still is something to get mad at -_-",1,19,144,97,0.76673072,3.305341268,3.198097365,
1184,14,"Yeah, I live in Texas and have seen similar things happen quite a bit. It seems to me that if a person has spent their entire life here and acted like a citizen, then they should be treated like one. ",2,19,145,96,1.402803588,2.442538095,2.789384263,
1184,15,That's what I think. I thought people get their citizenship after 15 years of staying here anyway.,1,19,144,97,0.896644441,1.854843414,2.18342936,
1184,16,"No, apparently not. We seem to just be looking for reasons to deport people, even using the smallest technicalities. We have deported people who served in the military when it turned out that they weren't really citizens.",2,19,145,96,1.977151767,2.387267542,2.612149187,

1184,19,They shouldn't have been deported. I'm a little appalled at that. How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.,1,19,144,97,2.122287464,3.74899323,3.234664951,
1184,20,The problem is that the changes we have made are designed to hurt people. When I read about the man in the article all I saw was us punishing someone who was trying to do the right thing. The thing is that most of the people around here are all for that sort of behavior.,2,19,145,96,2.108642697,3.31139648,2.937729325,
1184,21,I wouldn't be surprised. Many people in America are oppressors. Even some of the oppressed go on to oppress people who are more vulnerable than them. I feel sad for them going through such things.,1,19,144,97,2.119489257,3.117017102,3.068576353,

1196,11,Nope. I don't have much else to say about these civilian strikes. I get the impression that these were drone strikes,1,6,49,62,1.427613854,1.585339725,1.285676888,
1196,12,It is possible that the airstrikes were carried out by manned aircraft or drones,2,6,51,63,1.267306685,1.411050189,1.492395673,

1196,27,Right. The Junger book was interesting. The author spent some time over there himself- to get a better story (I guess),1,6,49,62,0.790870873,1.546997499,1.444588295,

1198,15,I think it was intentional,1,7,68,65,1.750104411,1.818707752,1.912395298,
1198,16,it seems like the driver refused to stop for some reason,2,7,67,64,1.794029697,1.447127783,2.018916539,

1199,4,"I thought it was strange how the US troops not only failed to stop at the checkpoint, but then even exchanged gunfire with the Jordanians.  They must have been very confused or doing something very bad.",2,7,60,67,1.963392886,2.446695423,2.831070645,

1199,8,"Yes, I think that even if accidental and unfortunate deaths occur in situations like this, these people are still fighting for a good cause.  Unfortuantely, bad things happen in war and dealing with things like terrorism, but they're sort of necessary evils to prevent a lot more people from dying or suffering.",2,7,60,67,0.968958475,2.742594647,2.847831641,
1199,9,"It seems that when tragedies like these happen, people just 'tune it out' becuase it feels so far away.",1,7,58,66,1.692448012,2.213310266,2.285455721,
1199,10,"Yes, although I would say that it's unreasonable to think that people can, or should, take seriously and personally every piece of news they come across.  We're exposed to too much news nowadays.  The world has gotten too big.  You have to tune a lot of it out because it'll drive you crazy otherwise.  Most of it doesn't really affect us anyway.",2,7,60,67,1.427536464,2.264415455,2.133195017,

1199,13,ok i understand,1,7,58,66,0.81908435,1.310108614,1.212383526,
1199,14,"I think one can vote for people who have a visioin of how to deal with these issues.  There are people who think we should be actively engaged in these problems, and people who think we should just ignore them, that they aren' our country's problem.  One can always vote for the person they think will push for their vision of America's invovlement of these things.  I just want us to keep destroying terrorism, wherever it is.",2,7,60,67,1.163157678,2.346451831,2.151020016,

1199,17,Yes absolutly correct. i appricate you,1,7,58,66,0.605086678,1.999058867,1.588286195,
1199,18,"Thank you.  I appreciate you, too.  What other emotions did the article make you feel?  I guess I also felt pretty impotent, and frustrated that these challenges exist all over the world and I'm not sure we're making much progress.",2,7,60,67,1.540444283,2.631387043,2.119586519,

1199,20,"Yes, there's lots of death and destruction all over the world.  And oftentimes civilians are the casualties.  I hope the civilians realize they have a part to play though.  If you allow terrorism to take hold in your country, you suffer the consequences one way or another.

1199,22,"I am most definitely reading your questions and comments.  If you want to bring more attention to this issue, I think you should find an organization that's trying to do something about it and volunteer to help them raise money, help, or advocate for these civilians.",2,7,60,67,0.648822709,1.942004192,1.895873453,
1199,23,How would you help the civilian's plight?,1,7,58,66,0.975795178,1.339067173,1.704679566,
1199,24,"I would keep fighting the terrorists and showing the civilians that there's a simple choice to be made here.  You either stop putting up with terrorism in your country and actively seek a stable, peaceful nation, or you continue to deal with chaos and war.  Those are the choices.  I think the civilians ultimately have to decide what type of country they want to live in and to fight for it, just like Americans did in the Revolutionary War, and innumerable other wars.",2,7,60,67,1.210235373,2.543505406,2.545847535,

1199,28,"No.  I don't.  I think ""awareness"" allows weak-minded people to placate themselves and believe they've done something to help a cause.  It's just something people talk about so they don't feel guilty.",2,7,60,67,1.819454082,2.829795766,2.109458353,

1202,11,I applaud the effort and bravery of everyone who's in the front line. I probably would get PTSD the first day there,1,7,49,68,1.283677721,3.180314898,2.86605072,
